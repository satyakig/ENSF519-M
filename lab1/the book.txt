chapter i
a wonderful story
well what do you think of it mark asked jack darrow as he laid
aside a portion of a newspaper covered with strange printed
characters great is not it
you do not mean to tell me that you believe that preposterous story do
you jack and mark sampson looked across the table at his companion
in some astonishment
oh i do not know it may be true went on jack again picking up the
paper and gazing thoughtfully at it i wish it was
but think of it exclaimed mark why if such a thing exists and if
we or some one else should attempt to bring all those precious stones
to this earth it would revolutionize the diamond industry of the
world it can not be true
well here it is in plain print you can read it for yourself as you
know the martian language as well as i do it states that a large field
of reonaris was discovered on the moon near mare tranquilitatis or
tranquil ocean i suppose that could be translated and that the men
of mars brought back some of the reonaris with them here read it if
you do not believe me
oh i believe you all rightthat is i think you have translated
that article as well as you can but suppose you have made some error
we did not have much time to study the language of mars while we were
there and we might make some mistake in the words that article might
be an account of a dogfight on the red planet instead of an account
of a trip to the moon and the discovery of a field of reonaris eh
jack
of course i am likely to have made an error for it is not easy to
translate this stuff and jack gazed intently at the strangely printed
page which was covered with characters not unlike greek i may be
wrong went on the lad but you must remember that i translated some
other articles in this paper and professor henderson also translated
them substantially as i did and professor roumann agreed with him
there is reonaris on the moon and i wish we could go there and
get some
but maybe after you got the reonaris it would turn out to be only
common crystals objected mark
no exclaimed jack reonaris is what the martians call it in their
language and that means diamonds i am sure of it
well i do not agree with you declared the other lad
do not be cranky and contrary begged jack
i am not but what is the use of believing anything so wild and weird as
that it is a crazy yarn
it is nothing of the sort there are diamonds on the moon and i can
prove it
well do not get excited suggested mark calmly i do not believe it
that is all you are mistaken about what reonaris is that is what you
are
i am not jack had arisen from his chair and seemed much elated in
his hand he held clinched the paper which had caused the lively
discussion it was as near to a disagreement as jack darrow and mark
sampson had come in some time
sit down begged mark
i will not retorted jack i am going to prove to you that i am right
how are you going to do it
i am going to get professor henderson and professor roumann to
translate this article for you and then you can ask them what reonaris
is guess that will convince you will not it
maybe but why do not you ask andy sudds or washington white to give
their opinion
do not get funny advised the other lad sharply and then seeing that
his chum was smiling jack laughed cooled down a bit looked at the
paper which he had crumpled in his hand and said
i guess i was getting a little too excited but i am sure i am right
here is the paper i brought from mars to prove it and the only thing
there is any doubt about is whether or not reonaris means diamonds i will
ask
at that moment the door of the library in which jack and mark were
seated was cautiously opened and a black woolly head was thrust in
then two widelyopened eyes gazed at the boys
what is the matter washington asked jack with a laugh
 iscuse me massa jack answered the colored man but did i done heah
you to promulgate some conversationess regarding de transmigatorability
ob diamonds
do you mean were we talking about diamonds inquired mark
dat is what i done said massa mark
no you did not say it but you meant it i guess went on jack
yes we were talking about diamonds washington i know a place
that is full of them
where inquired the colored man thrusting his head farther into the
room and opening his eyes to their fullest extent ef it is not
violating no confidences massa jack would you jest kindly mention it
to yo is truly and professor henderson is faithful servant who had
followed him into many dangers looked at the two boys who of late
years had shared the labors of the wellknown scientist where am
dose diamonds massa jack
on the moon was the answer
on de moon ha ha dat is a joke and washington began to laugh on
de moon ha ho
well you can read it for yourself went on the lad tossing the
paper over to the colored man the latter picked it up gazed at it
first from one side and then from the other next he turned it upside
down but as this did not make the article any clearer he turned the
paper back again then he remarked with a puzzled air
well i neber could read without mah glasses massa jack so i guess
i will hab to let it go until annoder time diamonds on de moon eh
dat is wonderful i wonder what dey will be doing next but i ise got to 
go diamonds on de moon eh diamonds on de moon
as washington turned to leave the room for he had entered it when jack
and mark were talking to aim the latter lad asked
did you want to see us about anything particular wash
why i suah did was the reply i did come to tell you dat perfesser
henderson would be pleased to hold some conversations wid you but when
massa jack done mentioned about dem diamonds i clean forgot it
diamonds on de moon eh
well if the professor wants us we would better go suggested mark come
on jack and stop dreaming about reonaris and the moonbeams get back
to earth
all right laugh if you want to said jack sturdily but the time
will come mark when you will find out that i am right
how asked mark
i do not know but i am sure i can prove what i say
the two boys were to have the wonderful diamond story demonstrated to
them sooner than either expected following the colored man the lads
jack carrying the paper made their way to the laboratory of professor
henderson his door was open and the aged man whose hair and beard
were now white with age was bending over a table covered with papers
chemical apparatus test tubes alembecs bunsen burners globes and
various pieces of apparatus another man not quite so old as was mr
henderson was on the point of leaving the apartment
ah boys remarked the older professor as he caught sight of them
i hope i did not disturb you by sending for you
no jack and i were only having a redhot discussion about diamonds on
the moon said mark with a laugh
diamonds on the moon exclaimed professor henderson
diamonds on the moon repeated his friend prof santell roumann is
this a joke boys
mark thinks so but i do not cried jack enthusiastically look
here professor henderson and also mr roumann here is one of the
newspapers that we brought back with us in our projectile the
annihilator after our trip to mars i have been translating some of
the articles in it and tonight i came across one that told of a trip
made by some of the inhabitants of mars to the moon in a sort of
projectile like ours only more on the design of an aeroplane
they landed on the moon the article states and found a big field or
deposit of reonaris which i claim are diamonds mark says i am wrong
but professor henderson is not reonaris to the martians what diamonds
are to us
it certainly is agreed the older scientist and he looked for
confirmation to his scholarly companion
reonaris is substantially a diamond said professor roumann it has
the same chemical constitution and also the diamond is hardness and
brilliancy but i do not understand how any diamonds can be on the
moon
you can read this for yourself suggested jack passing over the
paper which was one of some souvenirs brought back from what was the
longest journey on record ever taken by human beings
mr roumann adjusted his glasses and carefully read the article that
was printed in such strange characters as he perused it he nodded his
head thoughtfully from time to time then he passed the paper to
professor henderson
the older scientist was somewhat longer in going over the article but
when he had finished he looked at the two boys and said jack is
right this is an account of a trip made to the moon by some of the
martians who have advanced much further in the art of air navigation
than have we some of the words i am not altogether familiar with but
in the main that is what the paper states
and does not it tell about them finding a field of reonaris asked
jack eagerly for he was anxious to prove to his chum that he was
right
yes it does replied mr henderson
and reonaris is diamonds is not it asked jack
it is answered professor roumann gravely
then cried jack what is to hinder us from going to the moon and
getting some of those diamonds the martians must have left some let is
go to the moon and get them we can do it in the projectile with which
we made the journey to mars let is start for the moon
for a moment there was silence in the laboratory of the scientist it
was broken by washington white who remarked
good land a massy annodder ob dem trips through de air well i
is not going to no moonno sah ef i went dere i would suah get looney
and i has troubles enough now widout dat i suah has and shaking
his head dubiously the colored man shuffled from the room
chapter ii
something about our heroes
are you in earnest in proposing this trip asked professor henderson
of jack the lad with flushed face and bright eyes stood in the
centre of the apartment holding the paper which the aged scientist had
returned to him
i certainly am was the reply it ought not to be a difficult
undertaking after our trip to the north pole through the air the one
to the south pole under water our journey to the centre of the earth
and our flight to mars why a trip to the moon ought to be a little
pleasure jaunt like an automobile tour can not we go professor
from the standpoint of possibility i presume we could make a trip to
the moon the scientist admitted it would not take so long nor
would it be as dangerous as was our trip to mars and yet i do not
know that i care to go i am getting along in years and i have money
enough to live on even a field of diamonds hardly sounds attractive to
me jack is face showed the disappointment he felt
and yet went on the aged scientist with a smile there are certain
attractions about another trip through space i had hoped to settle
down in life now and devote my time to scientific study and the
writing of books but this is something new we never have been to the
moon and
there are lots of problems about it that are still unsolved cried
jack eagerly you will be able to discover if the moon has an
atmosphere and moisture and also what the other sidethe one that is
always turned away from uslooks like
it does sound tempting went on the aged scientist slowly and we
could do it in our projectile the annihilator it is in good working
order is not it professor roumann
could not be better if you ask me i for one would like to make a
trip to the moon it would give me a better chance to test the powers
of cardite that wonderful red substance we brought from mars i can
use that in the etherium motor if you left it to me i would say go to
the moon
well perhaps we will spoke mr henderson thoughtfully
you will go too will not you mark asked jack
oh i am not going to be left behind i will go if the rest do but i
do not believe you will find any diamonds on the moon if there ever were
any the martians took them for mark had been partly convinced after
the confirmation by the two professors of jack is translation
i will take a chance on the sparklers said his chum but now let is
go into details and figure out when we can start it ought not to take
very long to get ready
as has been explained in detail in the other books of this series
professor amos henderson and the two lads mark sampson and jack
darrow had undertaken many strange voyages together sometimes they
were accompanied by friends and assistants while washington white a
sort of servant helper and manofallwork and andy sudds an old
hunter always went with them
mark and jack were orphans who had been adopted by professor
henderson who spent all his time making wonderful machines for
transportation or conducting strange experiments
the two boys had been rescued by professor henderson and washington
white from a train wreck although both boys were badly hurt they were
nursed back to health by the eminent scientist who soon learned to
care for the lads as though they had been his own sons
they aided the professor as soon as they were able in constructing an
airship called the electric monarch in which professor henderson
hoped to be able to reach the north pole the boys thoroughly enjoyed
the trip through the air and had many thrills fighting the savage
eskimos finally they succeeded in passing over the exact spot of the
north pole during a violent snowstorm
not satisfied with their experiences after conquering the north the
adventurers set out for the antarctic regions in a submarine boat this
trip even more remarkable than the first took them to many strange
places in the south atlantic they were trapped for a time in the
sargasso sea and they walked on the ocean floor in new diving suits
one of the professor is marvelous inventions
it was on the voyage to the south that coming to the surface one day
the adventurers saw a strange island in the atlantic ocean far from
the coast of south america on it was a great whirlpool into which the
porpoise their submarine boat was nearly drawn by the powerful
suction
the chasm might lead to the center of the earth it was suggested and
after thinking the matter over on their return from the antarctic
professor henderson decided to build a craft in which they might solve
the mystery
the details of the voyage they took in the flying mermaid are told
of in the third volume entitled five thousand miles underground the
mermaid could sail on the water or float in the air like a balloon
in this craft the travellers descended into the centre of the earth
and had many wonderful adventures they nearly lost their lives and
had to escape after running through danger of the spouting water
leaving their craft behind
for some time they undertook no further voyages and the two boys who
lived with professor henderson in a small town on the coast of maine
were sent to attend the universal electrical and chemical college
washington remained at home to minister to the wants of the old
professor and andy sudds went off on occasional hunting trips
but the spirit of adventure was still strong in the hearts of the boys
and the professor one day in the midst of some risky experiments at
college jack and mark as related in through space to mars received
a telegram from professor henderson calling them home
there they found their friend entertaining as a guest professor santell
roumann who was almost as celebrated as was mr henderson in the
matter of inventions
professor roumann made a strange proposition he said if the old
scientist and his young friends would build the proper kind of a
projectile they could make a trip to the planet mars by means of a
wonderful motor operated by a power called etherium of which mr
roumann held the secret
after some discussion the projectile called the annihilator from
the fact that it annihilated space was begun it was two hundred feet
long ten feet in diameter in the middle and shaped like a cigar it
consisted of a double shell of strong metal with a nonconducting gas
between the two sides
within it were various machines besides the etherium motor which
would send the projectile along at the rate of one hundred miles a
second this great speed was necessary in order to reach the planet
mars which at the time our friends started for it was about thirty
five millions of miles away from this earth it has since receded some
distance farther than this
finally all was in readiness for the start to mars professor roumann
wanted to prove that the planet was inhabited and he also wanted to
get some of a peculiar substance which he believed gave the planet its
rosy hue he had an idea that it would prove of great value
but though every precaution was taken the adventurers were not to get
away from the earth safely almost at the last minute a crazy
machinist named fred axtell who was refused work on the projectile
tried to blow it up with a bomb he partly succeeded but the damage
was repaired and the start made
inside the projectile our friends shut themselves up and the powerful
motors were started off it shot at the rate of one hundred miles a
second but the travellers were as comfortable as in a pullman car
they had plenty to eat and drink they manufactured their own air and
water and they slept when they so desired
but axtell the crazy machinist had hidden himself aboard and in
midair he tried to wreck the projectile he was caught and locked up
in a spare room but when mars was reached he escaped
the book tells how our friends were welcomed by the martians how they
learned the language saw many strange sights and finally got on the
track of the cardite or red substance which the german professor mr
roumann had come so far to seek this cardite was capable of great
force and properly controlled could move great weights and operate
powerful machinery
our friends wanted to take some back to earth with them but when they
attempted to store it in their projectile they met with objections
for the martians did not want them to take any they had considerable
trouble and the crazy machinist led an attack of the soldiers of the
red planet against our friends the adventurers in the projectile
among the other curiosities brought away by our friends was a
newspaper printed in mars for the inhabitants of that place where much
further advanced along certain lines than we are on this earth but in
the matter of newspapers they had little to boast of save that the
sheets were printed by wireless electricity no presses being needed
as told at the opening of this story jack had noticed on one of the
sheets they brought back an account of how some of the martians made a
trip to the moon and discovered a field of reonaris this trip was
made shortly before our friends made their hasty departure and it was
undertaken by some martian adventurers on another part of the red
planet than where the projectile landed and so professor henderson and
his friends did not hear of it at the time
well then suppose we make the attempt to go to the moon said
professor roumann after a long discussion in the laboratory it will
not take long to get ready
i would like to go said jack how about you professor henderson oh
by the way washington said you wanted to see mark and me but i was so
interested in this news item that i forgot to ask what it as about
i merely wanted to inquire when you and mark thought of resuming your
studies at college said the aged man but since this matter has
come up it will be just as well if you do not arrange to resume your
lessons right away
we can study while making the trip to the moon suggested mark
not much declared jack with a laugh there will be too much to see
well we will discuss that later went on mr henderson practically
speaking i think the voyage can be made and the more i think of it
the better i like the idea we will look over the projectile in the
morning and see what needs to be done to it to get it ready for
another trip through space
not much will have to be done i fancy remarked the german
scientist but i want to make a few improvements in the cardite motor
which i will use in place of the etherium one that took us to mars
a little later there came a knock on the rear door of the rambling old
house where the professor lived and did much of his experimental work
i will go volunteered jack and when he opened the portal there stood
on the threshold a small boy dick johnson one of the village lads
what is it you want dick asked mark
here is a note for you went on the boy passing over a slip of paper
i met a man down the road and he gave me a quarter to bring it here
he said it was very important and he is waiting for you down by the
white bridge over the creek
waiting for who asked jack
for mark i guess but i do not know anyhow the note is for him
hum this is rather strange mused mark
what is it asked jack
why this note it says it is important that i see you i will wait
for you at the white bridge that is all there is to it
no name signed asked jack
not a name but i will just take a run down and see what it is i will not
be long much obliged dick
the boy who had brought the note turned to leave the house and mark
prepared to follow jack said
let me see that note
he scanned it closely and as mark was getting on his hat and coat
for the night was chilly his chum went on
mark if i did not know that we had left axtell the crazy machinist
up on mars i would say that this was his writing but of course it is
impossible
of courseimpossible agreed mark
but there is one thing though continued jack
what is that asked mark
i do not like the idea of you going off alone in the dark to meet a
man who does not sign his name to the note he wrote so if you have no
objections i will go with you no use taking any chances
i do not believe i run any risk said mark but i will be glad of your
company come along maybe it is only a joke and the two lads started
off together in the darkness toward the white bridge
chapter iii
preparing for a voyage
seems like rather an odd thing does not it remarked jack as he and
his chum walked along
what
this note
oh yes but what made you think the writing looked like that of the
crazy machinist who tried to wreck the projectile
because i once saw some of the crazy letters he sent us and he wrote
just like the man who gave dick this note but come on let is hustle
and see what is up
in a few minutes they came in sight of the white bridge which was
about a quarter of a mile down the road from the professor is house the
two boys kept well together and they were watching for a first sight
of the man in waiting
see anything asked jack
no do you
not a thing wait until we get closer he may be in the shadow it is
dark now
almost as jack spoke the moon which had been hidden behind a bank of
clouds peeped out making the scene comparatively bright the boys
peered once more toward the bridge and as they did so they saw a
figure step from the shadows stand revealed for an instant in the
middle of the structure and then seemingly after a swift glance
toward the approaching chums the person darted off in the darkness
did you see that cried jack
sure assented mark guess he did not want to wait for us why he is
running to beat the band
let is take after him suggested jack and nothing loath mark
assented the two lads broke into a run but as they leaped forward
the man also increased his pace and they could hear his feet pounding
out a tattoo on the hard road
the two youths reached the bridge and sped across it they glanced
hastily on either side thinking possibly the man might have had some
companions but no one was in sight and the stranger himself was now
out of view around a bend in the highway
no use going any farther suggested jack pulling up at the far side
of the bridge there are two roads around the bend and we could not
tell which one he would take besides it might not be altogether safe to
risk it
mark and jack on their return told professor henderson and the german
scientist something of their little excursion
but who could he have been asked mr roumann perhaps if you ask
the boy who brought the note he can tell you
we will do it in the morning decided mark
it is peculiar that he wanted mark to meet him spoke amos henderson
have you any enemies that you know of mark
not a one but what makes you think this man was an enemy professor
from the fact that he ran when he saw you and jack together evidently
he expected to get mark out alone
they discussed the matter for some time and then the boys and the
scientists retired to bed ready to begin active preparations on the
morrow for their trip to the moon
there was much to be done but their experience in making other
wonderful trips particularly the one to mars stood the travellers in
good stead they knew just how to go to work
to washington was entrusted the task of preparing the food supply
since he was to act as cook andy sudds was instructed to look after
the clothing and other supplies except those of a scientific nature
while the two young men were to act as general helpers to the two
professors
as the annihilator has been fully described in the volume entitled
through space to mars there is no need to dwell at any length on the
construction of the projectile in which our friends hoped to travel to
the moon sufficient to say that it was a sort of enclosed airship
capable of travelling through spacethat is air or etherat enormous
speed that there were contained within it many complicated machines
some for operating the projectile some for offence or defence against
enemies such as electric guns apparatus for making air or water and
scores of scientific instruments
the annihilator was controlled either from the engine room or from a
pilot house forward as for the motive power it was for the trip to
the moon to be of that wonderful martian substance cardite which
would operate the motors
the projectile moved through space by the throwing off of waves of
energy similar to wireless vibrations from large plates of metal and
these plates were the invention of professor roumann
perhaps to some of my readers it may seem strange to speak so casually
of a trip to the moon but it must be remembered that our friends had
already accomplished a much more difficult journey namely that to
mars so the moon voyage was not to daunt them
mars as i have said was thirtyfive millions of miles away from the
earth when the annihilator was headed toward it to reach the moon
however but 252972 miles at the most must be traverseda little
more than a quarter of a million miles as the distance from the earth
to the moon varies being between the figures i have named and 221614
miles with the average distance computed as being 238840 miles it
can readily be seen that at no time was the voyage to be considered as
comparing in distance with the one to mars
but there were other matters to be taken into consideration and our
friends began to ponder on them in the days during which they made
their preparations
chapter iv
an accident
washington white was kept busy getting together the food for the
voyage and he had about completed his task while andy sudds announced
one morning that his department was ready for inspection and that he
thought he would go hunting until the projectile was ready to start
well if you see anything of that queer man who sent me the note just
ask him what he meant by it suggested mark for inquiry from the boy
who had brought the message developed the fact that dick did not know
the man nor had he ever seen him before he was a stranger in the
neighborhood but as nothing more resulted from it the two lads gave
the matter no further thought
how soon before we will be ready to start asked jack one day while
he and his chum with the two professors were working over the
projectile which was soon to be shot through space
in about two weeks replied mr roumann i want to make a few
changes in the cardite plates which will replace the ones used on the
etherium motor then i want to test them and if i find that they work
all right as i hope we will seal ourselves up in the annihilator
and start for the moon
are you going to try to go around it and land on the side turned away
from us asked mark who had been studying astronomy lately
what do you mean by that asked jack does not the moon turn around
not as the earth does replied his chum or rather to be more
exact it rotates exactly as the earth does on its axis but in doing
this it occupies precisely the same time that it takes to make a
revolution about our planet so that in the long run to quote from my
astronomy it keeps the same side always toward the earth and today
or to be more correct each night that the moon is visible we see the
same face and aspect that galileo did when he first looked at it
through his telescope and unless something happens the same thing
will continue for thousands of years
then we have never seen the other side of the moon asked jack
never and that is why i wondered if the professor was going to attempt
to reach it perhaps there are people there and air and water for it
is practically certain that there is neither moisture nor atmosphere on
this side of luna
wow then maybe we would better not go said jack with a shiver what
will we do if we get thirsty
oh i guess we can manage with all the apparatus we have to distill
enough water said professor henderson with a smile then too we
will take plenty with us and of course tanks of oxygen to breathe
but it will be interesting to see if there are people on the moon
if there are any they must have a queer time went on mark
why asked jack who was not very fond of study
why because the moon is only about one fortyninth the size of the
earth its diameter is 2163 milesonly a quarter of the earth isand
comparing the force of gravity ours is much greater a body that
weighs six pounds on the earth would weigh only one pound on the moon
and a man on the moon could jump six times as high as he can on this
earth and throw a stone six times as far
what is dat inquired washington white quickly nearly dropping some
packages he was carrying into the projectile what was you pleased to 
saggasiate in remarking concerning de untranquility ob the densityness
ob stones jumping ober a man what is six times high he asked
do you mean what did i say asked mark solemnly
dat is what i done asked you spoke the colored man gravely
well you did not but perhaps you meant to went on the youth and he
repeated his remarks
 iscuse me i guess i would better not go on dish yeah trip after all
came from washington
why not demanded professor henderson
cause i is not going to no place whar ef you wants to take a little
jump you has to go six times as far as you does when you is on dis yeah
earth and sposing some ob dem moon men takes a notion to throw a
stone at me whar will i be when a stone goes six times as far as it
does on heah no sah i is not going
but perhaps there are no men on the moon said mark quickly it is
only a theory of astronomers that i am talking about
oh only a theory eh asked washington quickly
that is all
oh if it is only a theory den i reckons it is all right came from
the colored man i did not know it were a theory dat makes it all
right it is jest in theory am it massa mark dat a stone goes six
times as far
that is all
oh well den why did not you say so fust dat it was only a theory i
do not mind theories ii used to eat them boiled and roasted befo de
wah and with a contented smile on his face washington went into the
projectile to finish stowing things away in his kitchen lockers
the big projectile was housed in the shed where it had been
constructed and the professor and the boys were working over it there
carefully guarded from curious eyes for the german inventor did not
want the secret of his cardite motor to become known
the work went on from day to day good progress being made the boys
were of great assistance for they were practical mechanics and had
had considerable experience
well i shall try the cardite motor tomorrow announced professor
roumann one night after a hard day is work on the projectile
do you think it will work asked mr henderson
i think so yes my experiments have made me hopeful
and if it does work when can we start asked jack
two days later that is if everything else is in readiness the food
and other supplies on board
they are all ready to be stowed away said andy sudds who had been
hunting all day
it was an anxious assemblage that gathered inside the big shed the next
day to watch professor roumann try the cardite motor would it work as
well as had the etherium one would it send them along through space at
enormous speed true they would not have to travel so far nor so
fast but more power would be needed since as it was feared no food
water nor air could be had on the moon many more supplies were to be
taken along than on the trip to mars and this made the projectile
heavier
we will test the cardite in this small motor first said mr roumann
as he pointed to a machine in the projectile used for winding a cable
around a windlass when there was necessity for hauling the annihilator
about without sending it into the air
into the receptacle of the motor the german professor placed some of
the wonderful red substance he had secured from mars then he closed
the heavy metal box that held it and looking about to see if all was
in readiness he motioned to those watching him that he was about to
shift the lever that would start the motor
if it works as well as i hope it will he said it ought to pull the
projectile slowly across the shopa task that would be impossible in a
motor of this size if operated by electricity gasoline or any other
force at present in use and if this small motor will do that i know
the large ones will send us through space to the moon all ready now
slowly the professor shoved over the lever while jack mark and the
others watched him carefully they were standing back of him in the
engine room of the projectile
there was a clicking sound as the lever snapped into place this was
succeeded by a buzzing hum as the motor began to absorb the great
power from the red substance which was not unlike radium in its
action there was a trembling to the great projectile
she is moving cried jack
hardly had he spoken when there was a flash of red fire a sound as of
a bursting bomb and everyone was knocked from his feet over backward
while professor roumann was hurled the entire length of the engine
room
the cardite motor has exploded cried mark professor roumann is
killed
chapter v
the work of an enemy
jack is first act on arising from amid a mass of tools into which he
had been tossed by the explosion was to run to where professor roumann
lay in a semiconscious condition an instant later mark slowly arose
and made his way to where professor henderson was rubbing his forehead
in a dazed fashion
are you hurt asked mark of his aged friend
i think not answered mr henderson slowly but i fear mr roumann
is see to him i am all right
he is breathing cried jack who had bent over the german he is not
dead at any rate
but he may be unless he gets attention said professor henderson
get my medicine chest mark and we will see what we can do for him
jack had raised the head of the injured man on his arm and was giving
him some water from a glass this partially revived the german and he
opened his eyes he looked around into the faces of his friends as if
scarcely comprehending what had happened and then as his gaze
wandered toward the disabled cardite motor he exclaimed
some enemy has done this the motor was tampered with the resistance
block was loosened and that caused the force of the cardite to shoot
out at the rear we must watch out for the work of this enemy
do not distress yourself about that now urged mr henderson are you
badly hurt do you need a doctor
the german slowly drank the rest of the water which jack gave him and
then gradually arose to a standing position
i am all right he said faintly except that i feel a trifle dizzy
something hit me on the head and the fumes from the cardite took away
my breath for a moment i think i shall be all right soon
here is the medicine chest exclaimed mark coming back into the
engine room mr henderson poured out some aromatic spirits of ammonia
into a graduated glass added a little water and gave it to his
fellow inventor who after drinking it declared that he felt much
better there was a cut on his forehead where a piece of the broken
motor had struck him but otherwise he did not seem injured
externally
as for the boys they were only stunned nor was mr henderson more
than momentarily shocked in a few minutes the german professor was
almost himself again
we must try to discover who our enemy is he said earnestly as he
looked over the disabled motor he might have blown up the whole
projectile by tampering as he did with the machinery had i been
testing the large instead of the small motor there would have been
nothing left of the annihilator or us either who could have done
this if that crazy machinist is around again
i do not believe he could get here from mars interrupted jack with a
smile
hardly added mark
no i guess he is still on the red planet so it could not have been
him went on mr roumann but it was some one
jack and mark at once thought of the odd man who had sent mark the
note and then had run away
could it have been him suggested jack
it is possible remarked professor henderson we must be on our
guard i wonder if washington
at that moment there sounded a violent pounding on the exterior of the
projectile and the voice of the colored man could be heard calling
am anything de mattah andy sudds and i is out heah and we heard
suffin going on in dere am anybody hurted
it is all over now wash replied jack for the two boys and the two
professors had shut themselves up in the projectile while they
conducted the experiment jack opened the door of the annihilator
and stepped out being met by the colored man and the old hunter
you have not seen any suspicious characters around have you wash
asked mark some one has been tampering with a motor and it
exploded
nobody is been around since i have been here announced andy sudds with
a significant glance at his gun
maybe it is some ob dem moonmen what do not laik de idea ob us going
dere arter dere diamonds volunteered the colored man
perhaps admitted jack with a smile but certainly some one has
been around here who had no business to be and we must find out who it
was better take a look around wash
i will help him said andy and with his rifle in readiness for any
intruders the old hunter followed the colored man outside the big
shed
meanwhile professor roumann and mr henderson were carefully examining
the exploded motor
i should have looked at the breech plug before turning on the power
said the german but i had no reason to suspect that anything was
wrong he went on to explain that the explosion was something like
that which occurs when the breechblock of a big navy gun is not
properly in place the force of the cardite instead of being directed
against the pistonheads of the motor shot out backward and almost
into the face of the professor who was operating the machine
but what could be their object asked mark who would want to injure
us or damage the projectile
some enemy of course declared jack but who the crazy machinist
is out of it and as for that man who sent the note to you he seemed
too big a coward to attempt anything like this
some one evidently sneaked in here and loosened the breechplug went
on mark and it was evidently done with the idea of delaying us the
enemy could not have desired to utterly disable the projectile or else
he would have tampered with the large motor instead of the small one
yes the object seems to have been to delay us admitted professor
henderson yet i can not understand why whoever did it evidently knows
something about machinery
i hope they did not discover the secret of my cardite motor said
professor roumann quickly
they hardly had time declared mark we have been in or around the
projectile nearly every minute of the day and whoever it was must
have watched his chance slipped in stayed a few seconds and then
slipped out again
they went carefully over the entire projectile but could find no
further damage done nor were there any traces of the person who had so
nearly caused a tragedy washington and andy after a careful search
outside the shed had to admit that they had no clews
well the only thing to do is to go to work and build a new small
motor announced professor roumann after once more looking over the
debris of the one that had exploded
will it take long asked jack
about two weeks fortunately i can use some of the parts of this one
or we would be delayed longer
still two weeks is quite a while suggested mark perhaps there will
be no diamonds left on the moon when we get there jack and he smiled
jokingly
oh i fancy there will the article in the paper from mars says there
was a whole field of them
this brings up another matter said professor henderson what will
happen if we bring back bushels and bushels of diamondswhich in
view of what the paper says may be possible we will swamp the market
and the value of diamonds will drop
then we must not throw them upon the market decided professor
roumann the scarcity of an article determines its value if we do
find plenty of diamonds it will give me a chance to conduct some
experiments i have long postponed because of a lack of the precious
stones we can use them for laboratory purposes and need not sell
them in fact with the cardite we brought back from mars we have no
lack of money so we really do not need the diamonds
it was decided in view of the shock and upset caused by the explosion
that no further work would be done that day and so after carefully
locking the shed and posting andy on guard with his gun the boys and
the professor went into the house to discuss matters and plan for work
the next day
mark said jack in a low voice as they followed the two scientists
i think it is up to us to try to find that mysterious man who sent the
note i think he did this mean trick
so do i and we will have a hunt for him let is go now
chapter vi
on the track
the two boys gazed after professors henderson and roumann the
scientists were deep in a discussion of various technical matters
which discussion it was evident made them oblivious to everything
else
shall we ask them inquired jack in a whisper
no what is the use queried mark let is go off by ourselves and
perhaps we can discover something if we could once get on the trail of
the man who wrote the note i think we could put our hands on the
person responsible for the blowing up of the motor
i agree with you we will not bother them about our plans and he waved
his hand toward the scientists who had by this time entered the
house
in the first place said mark as he and his chum turned from the
yard and walked along a quiet country road i think our best plan
will be to find dick johnson and ask him just where it was he met the
man who gave him a quarter to bring the note to me
what for asked jack
why then we can tell where to start from perhaps dick can give us a
description of the man or tell from what direction he came then we will
know how to begin on the trail
that is a good idea i guess we know where he disappeared to or
rather in nearly what direction so that will help some
sure well then let is find dick
to the inquiries of the two lads from the projectile dick johnson
replied that as he had asserted once before that the man was a
stranger to him
he was tall and had a big black mustache dick described but he
kept his hat pulled down over his eyes so i could not see his face very
well anyhow it was dark when i met him
where did you meet him asked mark
not far from your house he was standing on the corner where you turn
down to go to the woollen mill and as i passed him he asked me if i
wanted to earn a quarter
of course you said you did suggested jack
sure replied dick then he gave me the note and told me where to
take it and i did that was not wrong was it
no only there seems to be something queer about the man and we want
to find out what it is replied mark
what was the man doing when you saw him asked jack
standing and sort of looking toward your house
looking toward our house repeated jack was he anywhere near the
big shed where we build the machines
well i could not say maybe he might have been
i guess that is all you can tell us put in mark with a glance at his
chum to warn him not to go too much into details with dick for they
did not want it known that some enemy had tried to wreck the
projectile
yes i can not tell you any more admitted the small lad
well here is a quarter for what you did tell us said jack and if
you see that man again and he gives you a note for us just keep your
eye on him watch where he goes and tell us then you will get a half
dollar
gee i will be on the watch promised dick his eyes shining at the
prospect of so much money
come on suggested jack to his chum after the small chap had
departed let is go down by the white bridge and make some inquiries of
people living in that vicinity they may have seen a stranger hanging
around and perhaps we can get on his trail that way
all right agreed mark and they walked on together
they had gone quite a distance away from the bridge and had made
several inquiries but had met with no success and they were about to
give up and go back home
i know one person we have not inquired of yet said mark as they
tramped along
who is that
old bascomb who lives alone in a shack on the edge of the creek you
know the old codger who traps muskrats
oh sure but i do not believe he would know anything if he did he is so
cranky he would not tell you
maybe he would if we gave him a little money for some smoking
tobacco it is worth trying anyhow bascomb goes around a great deal
and he may have met a strange man in his travels
well go ahead we will ask him
the muskrat trapper did not prove to be in a very pleasant frame of
mind but after mark had given him a quarter bascomb consented to
answer a few questions the boys told him about looking for a strange
man describing him as best they could though they did not tell why
they wanted to find him
waal now i should not be surprised but what i know the very fellow
you want said the trapper i met him a couple of days back and i
think he is still hanging around fust i thought he was after some of my
traps but when i found he waant i did not pay no more attention to
him he looked jest like you say
where was he asked jack eagerly
walking along the creek sort of absentminded like
you do not know where he lives or whether he is staying in this
vicinity do you inquired mark
yaas i think i do replied the trapper
where cried jack eagerly
waal you know the old preakness homestead down by the bend of the
creek about four mile below here
sure we know it answered mark we used to go in swimming not far
from there
waal the old house has been deserted now for quite a spell went on
the trapper and there is not nobody lived in it but tramps but the
other night when i was coming past with a lot of rats i would jest taken
out of my traps i see a light in the old house thinks i to myself
that there is more tramps snoozing in there and i did not reckon it was
none of my business so i kept on but jest as i was walking past the
main gate some one come out of the house and hurried away i had a
good look at him and
who was it asked mark impatiently for the old trapper was a slow
talker
it was the same man you are looking for declared bascomb i am sure
of it and he is hanging out in the old preakness house if you want to 
see him why do not you go there
we will cried jack come on mark i think we are on the trail at
last
chapter vii
mark is captured
eagerly the boys hurried forward intent on making the best time
possible to the old preakness homestead which was a landmark for miles
around and which in its day had been a handsome house and estate
now it was fallen into ruins for there was a dispute among the heirs
and the property was in the chancery court
do you think we will find him there asked mark as they made their way
along the dusty highway hard to tell yet if he is hanging out in
this neighborhood that would be as good a place as any for him to
hide in
i wonder who he can be anyhow and how he knows me
give it up evidently he is not a tramp though he stays in a place
where there are plenty of the knights of the road
the boys increased their pace and were soon on the main road leading
to the preakness house and about a mile away from it we will soon be
there now remarked jack then we will see if we can find that man
as he spoke the lad put his hand in his pocket and a moment later
he uttered a startled cry
what is the matter asked mark in some alarm
matter why gee whiz if i have not forgotten to send that telegram
professor henderson gave me it is to order some special tools to take
along on our trip to the moon they did not come and the professor
wrote out a message urging the factory to hurry the shipment he gave
it to me to send just before the accident to the motor but when that
happened it knocked it out of my mind i guess i stuck the telegram in
my pocket and here it is yet and jack drew forth a crumpled paper
would not that make you tired he asked it is important and ought to
go at once the professor will not like it
i will tell you what to do suggested mark after a moment is thought
the telegraph office is not so far away from here you can cut across
lots and be there in fifteen or twenty minutes tell them to rush the
message and it may be in time yet anyhow we are going to be delayed
because of the accident to the motor so it will not make so much
difference but come on let is start and we can hurry back
i guess that is the best plan remarked jack dubiously for he did not
fancy a halfhour is tramp across the fields and back again then as he
thought of something else he called out
say mark there is no use of both of us going to the telegraph office
i will go alone as it is my fault and you can stay here and watch to
see if that strange man appears on the scene i will not be long and you
can wait for me here
how would it be if i went on a little nearer to the preakness house
asked mark i can meet you there just as well as here and something
may develop
good idea you go on and when i come back i will take the road that
leads through the old slate quarry and save some time that way i will
meet you right near the old barn that stands on the gilbert property
just before you reach the preakness grounds
all right i will be there but do not run your legs off we are out for
all day and there is not anything that needs to be done at home or
around the projectile so take your time
oh i will not go to sleep declared jack i want to see if we can not
solve the mystery of the man who writes such queer notes
jack started off across the fields at a swift pace while mark strolled
on down the road in the direction of the old preakness house he was
thinking of many things chiefly of the wonderful journey that lay
before them and he was wondering what the moon would look like when
they got to it
that it would be a wild desolate place he had no doubt for the
evidences of the telescopes of astronomers pointed that way and as is
well known the most powerful instruments can now bring the moon to
within an apparent distance of one hundred miles of the earth this is
true of the lick telescope which has a magnifying power of 2500 and
an object lens a yard across
but with this powerful telescope it has been impossible to
distinguish any such objects as forests cities or any evidences of
life on the moonthat is on the side that has always been turned
toward us
almost unconsciously mark went on faster than he intended and before
he knew it he had arrived at the barn where he had promised to wait
for his chum mark looked at his watch and found that he would still
have some time to linger before he could expect jack to return he sat
down on a stone beside the fence and looked about him the day was
warm for fall and the last of the crickets were chirping away while
in distant fields men could be seen husking corn or drawing in loads
of yellow pumpkins
i wonder if we will have pumpkin pie on the moon thought mark
though of course we will not i guess all we will have to eat will be
what washington takes along in the projectilethat is unless we find
people on the other side of the place
he sat on the stone for some minutes longer and then tiring of the
inactivity he arose and strolled about something seemed to draw him
in the direction of the old house which he knew was just around the
bend in the road
i guess there would not be any harm in my going along and taking a peep
at it mused the lad it will be some time before jack returns and i
may be able to catch a glimpse of our man i think i will go up where i
can see the place and i can come back in time to meet jack i will do
it maybe the fellow might escape while i am waiting
mark thus tried to justify himself for his action in not keeping to his
agreement with his chum of course it was not an important matter mark
thought though the results of his simple action were destined to be
more farreaching than he imagined he thought he would be back in time
to meet jack and so he strolled on going more cautiously now for in
a few minutes he would come in sight of the old deserted house and he
did not know what he might find there
mark is first sight of the preakness homestead was of two old stone
posts that had once formed a fine gateway the posts were in ruins
now and half fallen down being covered with virginia creeper the
leaves of which were now a vivid red mingled with green
nothing very alarming there said mark half aloud he could just
catch a glimpse of the roof of the house over the tops of the trees
which had not yet shed all their leaves guess i will go on a little
farther maybe our friend the enemy is sitting on the front porch
sunning himself
past the old gateway mark continued intending to proceed along the
highway until he got directly in front of the old mansion there he
knew he would have a good view unobstructed by trees or shrubbery
when the lad got to this place in the road he paused and stooped
over as if tying the lace of his shoe for it was his intention to
pass himself off if possible as a casual passerby so that in case
the mysterious man should be in the house his suspicions would not be
aroused by seeing the youth to whom he had written the note staring in
at him
and while he was apparently fussing with his shoe mark was narrowly
eying the old house
not a very inviting place thought mark i do not see why any man who
could afford anything better would stay thereunless he has some
strong motive for lingering in this section and that is probably what
this fellow has and i would like to discover it well i do not see any
signs of him so i guess i might as well go back and wait for jack
he will be along soon
he stood up took a good look at the house and was about to retrace
his steps down the highway when he saw the sagging front door of the
old mansion slowly open it creaked on the rusty hinges and mark
stared with all his might as he saw a man emerge a man who did not
look like a tramp for his clothes were of good material and cut and
fit him well nor did he wear a stubbly growth of beard but on the
contrary his face was clean shaven the man was about mark is size
perhaps a little taller and nearly as stout he stood on the sagging
porch and gazed off toward the road
well if that is the man dick johnson got the note from he is changed
mightily in appearance thought mark as he looked at the fellow he
is not very tall and he has not any black mustache but of course he may
have shaved that off and i suppose in the dark and when one is in a
hurry to earn a quarter it is hard to say whether a man is tall or
short i wonder if this can be the person we are looking for
mark hardly knew what to do he stood in the road undecided and
fairly stared at the man who had left the porch and was walking down
the weedgrown path he was looking straight at mark but if the
stranger was the person who had written the note and if he recognized
the lad he gave no sign to that effect
good afternoon said the man as he paused at the gap in the front
wall where once a gate had been pleasant day is not it
yeyes stammered mark wondering what to say next
live around here went on the man
not very far off
ah then you know this old shack
well i do not get over here very often do you live here ventured
mark boldly determining to do some questioning on his own account
me live here cried the man as if indignant well hardly i was
just passing and happening to see the old place and having a
fondness for antiques i stepped in but it is in bad shape i should
say tramps make it their hangout
it has that name said mark
there was a pause for a moment and the lad was a trifle embarrassed
the man was gazing boldly at him
i guess i have made a mistake thought mark this can not be the man we
want he does not live here and he does not look like him i would better be
getting back to meet jack
are you engaged at anything in particular questioned the man taking
a few steps nearer the youth
no i am not working but i expect to take a trip shortly with some
friends of mine answered mark
ah is that so and there was polite inquiry in the man is voice are
you going far
quite a distance mark wondered what the man would say if he told him
he was going to the moon
i wonder if you would do me a favor went on the man as i was
passing through this old house i saw on one of the outer doors an
oldfashioned knocker i am a collector of antiques and i would very
much like to have that but i need help in getting it off i do not
intend to steal it but if it is left here some tramp may destroy it
and that would be too bad i intend to remove it and then hunt up the
owners of this place and purchase it from them
it will be hard to discover who are the owners replied mark as the
title is in dispute
so much the better for me will you help me remove the knocker i will
pay you for your time
mark hesitated he did not like the man is manner and there was a
shifty uneasy look about his eyes still he might be all right but
mark did not like the idea of going into the old house with him alone
it might be safe and again it might not but the knocker was on an
outside door there could be no harm in helping him as long as it was
outside the man saw the hesitation in the lad is manner
it will not take us long the stranger said i want you to help me
pry off the knocker as i have no screwdriver to remove it i will pay
you well
as he spoke he came nearer to mark and the lad noticed that the man is
right hand was held behind his back this struck mark as rather
suspicious suddenly he became aware of a peculiar odor in the aira
sweet sickish odor he started back in alarm all his former
suspicions aroused the man seemed to leap toward him
look out suddenly cried the fellow look behind you
involuntarily mark turned he saw nothing alarming the next instant he
felt himself grasped in the strong arms of the man and a cloth that
smelled strongly of the strange sweetly sickish odor was pressed over
the lad is face
here stop let me go help help cried mark then his voice died
out he felt weak and sick and sank back an inert mass in the man is
arms
i guess i have got you this time whispered the fellow as he gazed
down on mark is white face i will put you where you will not get away
either and picking up the youth he carried him a prisoner into the
deserted house
chapter viii
jack is puzzled
whistling merrily with his mind as much on the big field of diamonds
he expected to discover on the moon as it was on anything else jack
darrow crossed over the meadows toward the telegraph office
by jinks it certainly will be great to fly through space once more
he mused of course it is not much of a trip only a quarter of a
million miles at most but it will be a little outing for us and then
those diamonds
a trip of a quarter of a million miles only a little outing but then
what can be expected of lads who had gone to mars and back again
jack lost no time in reaching the telegraph office where he left the
message to be sent urging the operator to rush it which that
official promised to do
twill not be no great hardship on me neither he said with a cheerful
grin seeing as how this is the only one i have had to send today i will
get it right off for you jack
jack meant to hurry back but just as he was turning out of the main
village street to cut across lots and join mark at the place agreed
upon jack saw two dogs fighting it was with the best intentions in
the world that he ran toward them for he wanted to separate them
however a man was ahead of him and soon had the two beasts apart but
jack lingered several moments to see if there would be a renewal of the
hostilities there was not and he hurried on in a short time he was
within sight of the barn where his chum had agreed to meet him
mark cried jack when he came within hailing distance
there was no response
maybe he is hiding to fool me thought the lad i will give him another
call
neither was there a reply to this shout and jack with a vague feeling
of fear in his heart hurried forward climbed the fence that separated
the field from the highway and fairly ran toward the barn
a glance sufficed to show that mark was not in sight and thinking
that his chum might be on the other side jack went around the
structure
oh you mark he called i am back let is get a move on and go to the
old house
silence was the only answer
that is queer murmured jack when he had made a circuit of the place
and had seen no sight of his friend i wonder if anything could have
happened to him perhaps he went inside and has fallen down the hay
mow i will take a look
he made a thorough inspection of the ramshackle old structure but
there was no evidence that mark had entered it and jack was soon quite
assured that no harm had befallen his friend in there then a sudden
thought came to him
why of course he exclaimed aloud i should have thought of that
before mark got tired of waiting and went on to the preakness house
i might have known i will go on and catch up to him there
jack had reasoned correctly but he could not know what had taken
place with only the old grim deserted mansion for a witness with a
lighter heart he set off down the road
it did not take him long at the pace he kept up to come within sight
of the old gateway with the creeper twining over the pillars then he
caught a glimpse of the house and he at once slackened his footsteps
no use rushing into this thing he reasoned in a whisper mark may
be in hiding taking an observation of the mysterious man and i do not
want to spoil it by butting in guess i will lie low for a while and
see what develops
crouching down beside some bushes that lined the roadway jack looked
toward the silent tumbleddown house and waited all was still
occasionally a shutter flapped in the wind the hinges creaking
dismally or some of the loose windowpanes rattled as the sash was
blown to and fro it was not a pleasant aspect and as the afternoon
was waning and the sun was going down while a cool wind sprang up
jack was anything but comfortable in his place of observation
and the one objection to it was that there was nothing to observe not
a sign of life was to be seen about the place and the broken windows
like so many unblinking eyes stared out on the fields and road
oh pshaw exclaimed jack at length i am not going to sit here this
way i am going up and take a look it can not bite me and if that man is
in there i can give him some sort of a talk that will make it look all
right i am going closer maybe mark is inside there waiting for me
though it is queer why he did not keep his agreement and wait for me at
the barn well here goes
though he spoke bravely it was not without a little feeling of
apprehension that jack started toward the old mansion he kept a close
watch for the advent of any person or persons who might be in the
house but when he reached the front porch and had seen no one he
felt more at ease
hello mark he cried boldly are you inside
he paused for an answer none came
this is getting rather strange murmured jack who was now quite
puzzled as to what to make of the whole matter mark must be here yet
why does not he answer me oh you mark he shouted at the top of his
voice
there was only silence and after waiting a few moments jack made up
his mind that the best plan would be to enter the house and look
around
he made a hasty search through the lower rooms but saw no sign of
mark it was the same upstairs and on the third floor there was no
evidence of his chum jack called again but got no reply
the garret next and then the cellar he told himself and these two
places darker and more dismal than any other parts of the old mansion
were soon explored
well if mark came here he is not here now thought jack and there is
no use in my staying any longer maybe something happened that he had
to go back home perhaps he is trailing the man we should have made up
some plan to be followed in case anything like that happened
deciding that the best thing he could do would be to go back home jack
came out of the old house as he did so he gave a final call
mark oh you mark are you anywhere about
what was that was it an answer or merely the echo of his own voice
jack started and then as he heard another sound he said
only the wind squeaking a shutter mark is not here
if jack had only known
through the quicklygathering darkness jack turned his steps toward
home on the way along the country road he kept a sharp lookout for any
sign of his chum and also he looked to see if he could catch a
glimpse of any person who might answer the description of the man they
suspected of tampering with the cardite motor
but the road was deserted save for an occasional farmer urging his
horses along that be might the more quickly get home to supper
it is mighty strange mused jack as he kept on i do not think mark
did just right and yet perhaps when it is all explained he may have
good reasons for what he did maybe i am wrong to worry about him and
just as likely as not he is safe home wondering what kept me but he
might have known that i would come back to the barn where i said i would meet
him of course that dogfight delayed me a little but not much
it was quite dark when jack reached the house where he and his chum
lived with the two professors there was a cheerful light glowing from
many windows and jack also noticed an illumination in the shed where
the projectile was housed
guess they are working on it to get it in shape for the trip sooner
than they expected he mused
jack was met at the door by washington white
hello wash greeted the lad
good land a massy where hab you been transmigatorying yo isef during
de period when the conglomeration of carbohydrates and protoids hab
been projected on to de interplanetary plane ob de rectangle
do you mean where have i been while supper was getting ready asked
jack
dat is zackly what i means massa jack
then why do not you say it
i done did dat is what i done supper is cold but where am massa
mark
what is not mark home cried jack starting back in alarm
no massa jack we is not seed him sence you two went off togedder
where you all been
mark not home gasped mark where is professor henderson wash i
must speak to him at once
he am out in de shed wif massa roumann
with fear in his heart jack dashed out toward the big shed
is not you going to hab some supper called washington
i do not want any supperyet flung back jack over his shoulder
chapter ix
a daring plot
mark sampson lay an inert mass in the arms of the man who had attacked
him through the sagging door of the old deserted house the captive
lad was carried and up creaking stairs
i guess no one saw me whispered the man i am safe so far and i
can work my scheme to perfection everything turned out well for me i
was just wondering how i could get this youth in my power and he
fairly walked into my hands now to keep him safe until i can take his
place in the projectile and have my revenge i have waited a long time
for it but it has come at last
pausing at the head of the creaking stairs the man looked behind him
to make sure that he was not being followed but not a sound broke the
stillness of the old house save the rattle and bang of the ruined
shutters
i am safe safe exulted the man with a cruel chuckle now to bind
him and hide him in the secret chamber
he laid mark down on a pile of bagging in a corner of a room at the
head of the stairs then still glancing behind him as if fearful of
being observed the man walked over to a mantlepiece fumbled about a
bit of carving that adorned the centre and pressed on a certain spot
a moment later the mantle seemed to swing out and there was revealed a
secret room the existence of which would never have been suspected by
the casual observer
taking some of the bags from the pile where the unconscious lad was
the man made a rude bed in the secret room then he carried mark in
and placed him in a fairly comfortable position first taking the
precaution however of binding his hands and feet
there whispered the man when he had finished i guess you will not
get away in a hurry now i will wait until dark and then i will give you
something to eat for i do not want you to starve but i must keep in
hiding for very likely there will be a search made for him guess i would
better stay here and see what happens and the mysterious man pressed
the spring that sent the mantle back into place again hiding all
traces of the secret room
it is a good thing i stumbled upon this hiding place he said to
himself it could not be better for what i want now to see what
happens next
he did not have long to wait for in a short time jack as we have
seen appeared on the scene and began his search at the sound of his
voice calling for mark the man started in his hiding place and
glanced uneasily at mark
he may hear and wake up he whispered
jack came upstairs in the deserted house and continued his search
there calling from time to time he gave one loud shout at the head of
the stairs and the very thing that the man feared would happen came to
pass
the effect of the drug having worn off mark stirred uneasily and
started up he heard jack is cry and uttered a halfarticulate answer
in an instant the man was at his side and had quickly gagged him this
had the further effect of awakening the unfortunate lad and he
struggled to loosen his bonds but they were too strongly tied he
endeavored to answer jack but only a meaningless mumble resulted for
the gag was effective
all you have to do is to keep quiet urged the man as he knelt
beside mark in the darkness as soon as your chum goes i will take that
thing out of your mouth and give you something to eat
jack is voice died away and presently as the ears of the man told him
the boy left the old house waiting some time to make sure that he
would not return the man removed the knot of rags from mark is mouth
and slightly loosened his bonds first warning him however that if he
attempted to escape he would be harshly dealt with
but what right have you to keep me here demanded the youth who are
you and what have i done to you that you should treat me this way
are you crazy do not you know that you are liable to arrest for this
no one can arrest me boasted the fellow
but why have you made me a prisoner demanded mark
for reasons of my own you will see very soon
but what have i done to you persisted the lad i never saw you
before that i know of unless you are the man who sent me the note
and who ran when my chum and i came to the bridge to meet you
i am the man was the answer with a chuckle
then you must be the one who tried to wreck our projectile went on
mark
yes i did that and now i am sorry for it for i have thought of a
much better scheme for getting even and having my revenge on you
but why do you want to be revenged on us
because of what you have done and the man is voice took on an ugly
tone
but what did we do begged mark
you will know soon enough was the answer with a cunning laugh and
then mark was sure he had to deal with a lunatic he ceased his
struggles to loosen the bonds and resolved to meet cunning with
cunning he would bide his time
will you promise to be quiet and not kick up a fuss if i get you
something to eat asked the man
yes but i would rather have a drink of water first i feel sick
very well you shall have some water i will have to go out and get it
but i must first blindfold you so that you will not discover the
secret of this room
mark could not help himself for he was bound and when the man had
tied a handkerchief over his eyes mark heard his captor moving about
next there came a sound as of some heavy body or object being pushed
across the room mark felt a draught of wind on his face but it ceased
instantly and he knew that he was alone he tried to work the bandage
from over his eyes and he endeavored to loosen his bonds for he did
not consider that this violated his promise but it was of no effect
presently he heard the moving shoving sound again and once more felt
the wind on his face then he heard the voice of his captor speaking
here is food and drink i am going to untie your hands so you can eat
but mind no fighting for i am a desperate man and i will not stand any
nonsense
he fumbled about the bonds and soon mark was free to stand up and use
his hands the bandage was taken from his eyes and he was able to peer
about his prison by the light of a candle which his captor had brought
mark is first glance was at the man he was the same one who had emerged
from the house to attack and drug him but as for recognizing in him
the person who had been at the bridge this was impossible as far as
mark could tell he had never seen the man before nor did he answer the
description given by dick johnson
there was little danger that mark would attempt violence he was too
weak and his jailer seemed a powerful fellow then too the lad felt
ill from the effects of the drug
drink some water and eat a bit and you will feel better urged the
man which advice mark followed though his appetite was not of the
best and he was much worried as to what his friends would think about
his strange disappearance
what do you intend to do with me asked mark when he felt a little
better from the effects of the food and drink the man had sat on an
old soap box and watched his captive while he ate
do with you why i am going to keep you here until your friends have
left in the projectile was the answer
but why do not you want me to go with them
oh i have my reasons you will find out soon enough you can not go
that is all
but why do you take such an interest in me why did not you capture my
chum jack too while you were about it
two reasons one was that jack would not answer my purpose and the
other was that i did not have a chance to get him you walked right into
my trap just when i was doing my best to think of another plan to get
hold of you since my first one failed
but what is your purpose insisted the lad what do you want with
me he thought perhaps if he questioned the man closely enough he
might discover something that would give him a clew or might aid him
to escape
you will learn soon enough was the answer
will you tell me your name asked marie quietly
nowhy should i was the quick reply if i told you who i was you
would at once know why i have made you a captive here no you shall
hear all in good time but that will not be until i am ready
now went on his captor after a period of silence i shall have to
bind and blindfold you again
why asked mark in some alarm
because i do not want you to see how i get in and out of this room and
that is the only way i can guard my secret though if you promise not to
remove the bandage from your eyes within five minutes from the time i
leave you i will not have to tie your hands and feet after i am gone
you may take the handkerchief off but when you hear me rap on the
wall ready to come back again you must once more blindfold yourself
otherwise i shall have to tie you up
mark considered a moment it was not pleasant to be tied with the cruel
ropes and he felt that in time he could penetrate the mystery of how
the room opened even if he did not see his jailer enter and leave
i promise he said finally
that is good it simplifies matters now you can blindfold yourself
and i trust to your honor you may remove the bandage in five minutes
but when you hear me knock you must replace it until i am in the
apartment then you can take it off again
there was little choice but to obey and mark tied the handkerchief
over his eyes he listened intently heard the man moving about the
room felt the wind on his cheeks and then came silence
he waited until he thought five minutes had passed and then took off
the bandage the candle was burning where the man had set it but the
fellow himself was gone he had taken with him the broken dishes and
remains of the food mark had not eaten the glass and a pitcher of
water stood on a broken table and mark took a big drink
now to see if i can not get out of this place he murmured to himself
mark had invented many pieces of apparatus and he was considered a
good mechanician consequently he went about his task in a systematic
manner he examined the walls carefully by the candle which he carried
in his hand but no opening was apparent
of course there must be some secret spring to press said the lad
that is how he gets in and out a section of the wall moves but where
it is i can not see it will take time i must look at every inch
he was in the midst of his investigations when there sounded on the
wall back of him three raps
ha at least that tells me where the opening is thought the lad
it is on that side but now i have to put that blamed bandage on well
i may be able to escape yet
true to his promise he blindfolded himself well and presently he
heard a noise felt a draught of air and he knew his captor was in the
room
you can now take off the handkerchief said the man i have brought
you some more bags for bed clothing it is not much but it is all i
have they will keep you warm tonight
are you going to imprison me over night asked mark
yes and i will stay here with you no one can find us here the secret
room is well hidden but first i have another matter that needs
attention i am going to ask you a question
what asked the captive wondering what strange request the mentally
unbalanced man would make now
the man leaned forward and whispered something in mark is ear as if he
was afraid the very walls would hear
i will not do it cried the youth i will never aid you to deceive my
friends for that is your object i will never do it
then i shall have to use force was the determined response you may
take your choice
poor mark did not know what to do yet there was little he could choose
between the man had him in his power yet the lad was terribly afraid
of the result of the daring scheme which he knew was in the mind of the
lunatic for such he believed the man to be
will you not give up this plan begged mark i know professor
henderson will pay you any sum in reason to let me go you can become a
rich man
i do not want richesi want revenge exclaimed the man and he glared
at mark while throughout the dismal deserted house there sounded the
rattle and bang of the flapping shutters
chapter x
mark is strange actions
jack darrow fairly burst into the big shed where the two scientists
were at work over the ruined motor they looked up at his excitable
entrance and mr henderson called out
why jack what is the matter
quite a lot i am afraid answered the lad and there was that in his
voice which alarmed the professors
what do you mean inquired mr roumann laying aside some of the
damaged motor plates
mark is gone gasped jack
gone where exclaimed mr henderson
i do not know but he went to the deserted house where we thought the
mysterious man was hiding and since then i can not find him
then the frightened lad proceeded to explain what he and mark had
undertaken and the outcome of it how his chum had failed to meet him
at the rendezvous and how jack had searched through the old house
without result
there is but one thing to do declared professor henderson when he
had listened to the story we must go back there and make a more
thorough search
whattonight exclaimed the german
surely why not we can not leave mark there all alone he may be hurt
or in trouble
that is what i think said jack i will tell washington and andy and
we will go back and hunt for him poor mark if he had only waited for
me perhaps this would never have happened and if i had not stopped at
the dogfight maybe mark would have waited for me well it is too late
to worry about that now the thing is to find him and i guess we can
jack would not stop longer than to snatch a hasty bite of supper before
he joined the searching party washington and he carried lanterns
while andy sudds had his trusty rifle and the two professors brought
up in the rear armed with stout clubs for jack is account of the
affair made them think that perhaps they might have to deal with a
violent man
had not you better notify the police suggested andy a couple of
constables would be some help
not very much declared jack besides there are only two in
bayside and it is hard to locate either one when you want them i guess
we can manage alone
yes i would rather not notify the police if it can be avoided said
professor henderson
the searching party hurried along the country highway which was now
deserted as it was quite dark their lanterns flashed from side to
side but they had no hope of getting any trace of mark until they came
to the old barn at least though jack wished several times that he
might meet his chum running toward them along the road
they reached the barn in due course and while washington jack and
andy began a search of it the two scientists went up to the house of
the man who owned it and enlisted his aid they asked him if he had
seen mark around that afternoon but the farmer had not
but me and my hired man will come out and help you hunt through the
barn he said i remember once when i was a lad that my brother
fell off the hay mow and lay unconscious in a manger for five hours
before we found him maybe that is what is happened to this young man
suggested mr hampton which was the farmer is name
i looked around pretty well this afternoon explained jack when the
farmer and his man had reached the barn but of course i did not know
all the nooks and corners
a thorough search of the structure however failed to reveal the
presence of mark and then the farmer volunteered to accompany the
party on to the old preakness house his offer was received with
thanks and bringing two more lanterns with them mr hampton and his
man added considerable to the illumination
they went through the old mansion from garret to cellar and called
repeatedly but there was no answer and good reason for in the secret
room with his captive the mysterious man heard the first approach of
the searching party and he quickly bound mark and gagged him so that
he could not answer
there was nothing to do but to leave and it was with sad hearts that
jack and his friends departed their search having been unavailing
they turned toward home which they reached quite late but found
nothing disturbed
no one in professor henderson is house slept much that night and in the
morning pale and wan faces looked at each other all asking the same
question where is mark
but no one could answer
they talked over the matter and decided that jack with andy and
washington should form a searching party to scour the surrounding
country the two scientists were too old for such work and as the aid
of the police was not desired it was felt that the three could do all
that was necessary
accordingly while professor henderson and his german friend went to
work on the damaged motor which did not need as much repairing as at
first was thought to put it in working shape again jack and the two
men started off to hunt for mark
they were gone all that day returning very much discouraged at dusk
saying that they could get no trace of him
i do not see where he can be exclaimed jack desperately for though
the two lads were not related they had been friends so long and had
shared so many pleasures and dangers together that they were like
brothers you will not start for the moon until you find him will you
professor asked jack
no indeed though we could start tomorrow if he was here replied
the aged scientist the special tools came today and the motor has
been repaired we have tested it and the cardite power works even
better than did the etherium apparatus
then we can start as soon as mark is found asked andy sudds
yes for everything has been put inside the projectile and all that
remains is to haul it out of the shed point it at the moon and start
the motor
then i guess i will give my gun a final cleaning and get ready there
may be good hunting on the moon said the old hunter
jack was tired from his long tramp that day searching for his missing
chum but before he went to bed he wanted to go out and take a look at
the big projectile which was now ready to start for the moon
as he turned around the corner of the immense shed to enter the door
he was startled by seeing a figure coming toward him jack started
rubbed his eyes and peered again
is it possible can i be mistaken he whispered
the figure came nearer jack who had come to a halt broke into a run
mark mark he cried joyously oh you have come back where have you
been
jack was about to clasp his chum in his arms when he saw that mark is
arm was in a sling and that his face was all bandaged up so that
scarcely any of his features showed had it not been for the clothes
and a certain stoutness of which mark never could seem to get rid jack
would scarcely have known his friend
why mark what happened cried jack have you met with an accident
where have you been in a hospital what became of you why did not you
wait for me
i can not answer all those questions at once was the reply and jack
thought mark is voice was curiously muffled and hoarse entirely unlike
his usual tones but he ascribed that to the bandages around the mouth
well answer one at a time then said jack and there was an
undefinable strange air about his chum which cooled jack is first
impulse of gladness whatever happened to you mark are you hurt
i wasyes came the reply in short jerky tones i had an
accident and i have been in a hospital that is why i could not send you
word but i am all right now when does the projectile start
tomorrow now that you are here but tell me more about it where were
you hurt
on my head and arm
no i mean where did the accident occur
oh in the old house where i went toto look for that man
did you find him asked jack eagerly
no he is not there now
well never mind we will not bother about him come on to the house my
but i am glad to see you again and so will the others be
in his enthusiasm at seeing his chum again jack wanted to hug him he
approached mark but the latter cried out
look out do not come too close
why not have you caught some disease
no but you might hurt my broken arm
oh is it broken that is tough luck did you fall
yesin the old house i fell down stairs
and your head is all bandaged up too went on jack trying to peer
into his friend is face through the roll of bandages
look out do not come too near again warned the other you might
jostle against me and knock off some of the bandages
did you lose some of your teeth the reason your voice sounds so
funny asked jack
yes i did knock out a few when i tumbled but do not bother about me
i will be all right soon let is go in the house i want to go to bed
but they will all want to see you and hear about the accident mark
insisted jack my but we have been all worked up about you how did you
happen to be taken to a hospital
a farmer came along and i hailed him then i lost consciousness and
could not let you know where i was but never mind the details i am
anxious to get started on the trip to the moon could not we start
tonight
i do not believe so you need rest but come on in the house then
jack hurried on ahead calling mark is found mark is back
his cries brought all of the others out on the porch and at first they
could scarcely believe the good news but soon jack and the new arrival
came in sight as jack had been the two professors and the others were
startled when they saw how mark was bundled up in bandages
he fell down stairs explained jack
come over here where it is light so i can see you suggested
professor henderson perhaps some of the bandages have slipped off
since you came from the hospital why did you come alone why did not
you send us word where you were as soon as you were conscious and we
would have come for you
oh i did not want to bother you explained the bundledup figure i
managed to walk it all right
but your injuries may need attention insisted mr henderson i know
something about doctoring come here where i can see
nonothelight hurts my eyes was the hasty reply i guess i will
go to bed so as to be all ready to start in the morning why do not you
leave for the moon tonight professor
there are still a few little details to look after but are you sure
you are well enough to go with us we may meet with hardships up on the
moon
oh i am all ready to go was the answer i would start tonight if i
could but now i must get to bed
do not you want supper asked jack
no i had some just before i left the hospital
what hospital was it inquired andy sudds i was in one once and i
did not like it there want enough air for me
i forget the name of the place came the reply i can not think
clearly i need sleep
the newcomer kept in the shadows of the room as if the light hurt his
eyes and appeared restless and ill at ease with the hand that was not
in a sling he pulled the bandages closer about his face
can not you tell us more about what happened asked jack for mark was
not usually so reticent and his chum noticed it
there is not much to tell was the response i went to the old house
and i was looking around when i happened to tumble down stairs i must
have been knocked unconscious but when i came to i crawled outside a
farmer was driving past and i asked him to take me to a hospital
why did not you come home asked mr henderson
oh i did not want to make any trouble and delay work on the
projectile i figured that i could be with you in a few hours and you
would not worry but they insisted that i must stay in the hospital when
they got me there then i lost consciousness again and could not manage
to let you know where i was but i am all right now
why did not you wait for me at the barn when i went to send the
telegram as you promised you would asked jack who felt a little
hurt at his chum is neglect
did i promise to wait for you at some barn
yes do not you remember and jack gazed at the bandaged figure in
surprise
oh yesii guess i do but i want to go to bed now and pulling
the cloths closer about his face the injured one started from the
apartment
here that is not the way up to your room the stairs are over here
called jack for he saw the newcomer taking the wrong direction
oh yes guess my mind must be wandering and with an uneasy laugh
the injured one turned about they heard him going up stairs and a
little later jack followed he found that mark is room was not occupied
hi mark where are you he called in some alarm
here was the answer and the voice came from jack is own apartment
well you are in the wrong bunk
am i well i must have made another mistake my head can not be right
and with that the other came out and hastily went into the adjoining
apartment
for a moment jack stood in the hall he looked at the door that had
closed behind the bandaged figure
there is something wrong said jack in a low voice how strange mark
acts i wonder what can be the matter
chapter xi
ready for the moon
there were busy times for the moonvoyagers the next day they were up
early for at the last moment many little details needed to be settled
the cardite motor had been thoroughly repaired for the damage caused
by the unknown enemy had done no permanent harm
when the injured one appeared the bandage on his head seemed larger
than ever and his features were almost hidden he still wore his arm
in a sling
well how do you feel asked jack looking narrowly at the figure he
could not get rid of a suspicion that something was wrong with mark
oh i am feeling pretty fair was the mumbled answer i did not sleep
much though
well take care of yourself advised jack we are about ready to
start we will get off about noon professor henderson says do not try to
do anything and injure your broken arm you certainly had a tough time
of it
yes i guess i did i can not do much to help you
you do not need to we are all but finished just hang around and watch
me work there is not much to do
but though jack gave an invitation to remain near him the other seemed
to prefer being off by himself he wandered in and out of the
projectile now and then helping andy or washington to carry light
objects into the annihilator but all the while he was careful not to
disturb the bandage on his face and several times he stopped to
readjust it nor did he talk much which jack ascribed to his statement
that his teeth hurt him and when the bandaged figure did speak it was
in mumbling tones very different from mark is usually cheerful ones
well remarked professor roumann after a final inspection of the big
cardite motorthe one that was to be depended on to carry them to the
mooni think we are about ready to leave this earth how about it
professor henderson
yes i think so have you made any calculation as to speed
yes we will not have to move nearly as fast as we did when we went to
mars we only have to cover a quarter of a million of miles at the
most and probably less than that the motor will send us along at the
rate of about a mile a second which is three thousand six hundred
miles an hour or eightysix thousand four hundred miles aday at
that rate we would be at the moon in less than three days
but i do not want to travel as fast as that the german went on i
want time to make some scientific observations on the way and so i
have reduced the speed of the cardite motor by half though should we
need to hasten our trip we can do so
then we will be about a week on the way asked jack
about that yes assented mr roumann
and could we go farther than to the moon if we wanted to inquired
the bandaged figure mumblingly
farther what do you mean asked professor henderson quickly
i mean could we go to mars if we wanted to
you do not mean to say you want to go back there and run the chance of
being attacked by the savage martians do you asked jack
no i was only asking and the other seemed confused
well of course we could go there as we have plenty of supplies
and enough of the cardite said mr roumann but i think the moon
will be the limit of our trip this time
the work went on the last things to be put aboard the projectile being
a number of scientific instruments the injured one wandered in and
out now being in the house and again in the big shed he seemed
restless and ill at ease and frequently he walked to the front gate
and gazed down the road
you seem to be looking for some one spoke jack are you expecting
your girl to come along and bid you goodby mark
whome no ii was just looking to see ifif it was going to
rain
rain well rain will not make much difference to us soon we will be
outside of the earth is atmosphere in a jiffy after we have started and
then rain will not worry us is your stateroom all fixed up
no i did not think of that guess i would better look after it
the two started together for the projectile the stout one entered
first and made his way through the engine room and main cabin to the
compartment off which the staterooms opened he entered one
here that is not yours cried jack that is where professor henderson
sleeps yours is next to mine
that is right i forgot mumbled the other i must be getting absent
minded since my accident but i will be all right soon i will get my room
to rights and then probably we will start
i guess so answered jack but he shook his head as he gazed after
his chum mark has certainly changed he murmured i wish he would take
those bandages off so i could get a look at his face
the last details were completed the big annihilator had been run out
on trucks into the yard surrounding the shed ready to be hurled
through the air the shop shed and house had been locked up and given
in charge of a caretaker who would remain on guard until our friends
returned
are we all ready asked professor henderson as he stood ready to
close the main entrance door and seal it hermetically
all ready i guess answered jack the stout one had gone to his
stateroom where he could be heard moving about
i am ready announced professor roumann say the word and i will start
the motor he was in the engine room looking over the machinery at
that moment there came a loud yell from the galley where washington
white was
heah heah come back cried the colored man my shanghai rooster is
got loose he yelled and an instant later the fowl came sailing out
of the projectile with washington in full chase after him
i will help you catch him volunteered jack springing to the cook is
aid while professor henderson laughed and a bandaged figure looking
from a stateroom port wondered at the delay in starting the
projectile
chapter xii
mark is escape
mark sampson was alone in the deserted house bound hand and foot
stripped of his clothing and attired in some old garments that the
tramps who made a hangingout place of the old mansion had cast aside
the unfortunate lad was stretched on a pile of bagging his heart
beating partly with fear and partly with rage over a desire to escape
and punish the scoundrel responsible for his plight
the man who had captured him after taking away mark is clothes had
chuckled as though at some joke
you may think this is funny spoke the lad bitterly but you will not
be so pleased when my friends get after you
they will never get after me boasted the man this is a good joke to
think that i can pass myself off as you that i can join them in the
projectile and they never will be the wiser
they will soon discover that you are disguised as me declared mark
and when they do they will have you arrested
yes but they will not discover it until we have left the earth and are
on our way to the moon then it will be too late to turn back and my
object will have been accomplished i will be with them in the
annihilator and i will have my revenge the projectile is due to sail
tomorrow and i will be on hand i am going to leave you now i have left
orders with a friend of mine that you are to be released tomorrow
night in the meanwhile you will have to be as comfortable as you can
i wish you no harm but i must keep you here
i will feed you well before i go and put some water where you can get
it but i must leave you tied i will not gag you for no matter how you
yell no one will hear you i have posted a notice in front of this
place that it is under the watch of the police so no tramps will
venture in and your friends will not come back
now just make yourself comfortable here and i will go to the moon in
your place i think i shall enjoy the trip as i said you will be
released tomorrow night several hours after the projectile has left
the earth
how do you know it is to start tomorrow morning asked mark
oh i have been spying around and i overheard the professors talking
i know a thing or two and i will be on hand on time in your place
now i have to leave you i have left ten dollars to pay for your suit
which i need to disguise myself with
then the man was gone and mark was left with his bitter thoughts to
keep him company the whole daring scheme of the man had been revealed
he did look something like mark and attired in the lad is clothes and
by keeping his face concealed he might pass himself off as jack is
chum at least until after the projectile had started
and then as he says it will be too late to return to earth and get
me thought mark bitterly oh why did i ever try to learn this man is
secret who is he anyhow why did not i wait for jack at the barn as i
promised it is all my fault i wonder if i can not get loose
mark struggled several hours desperately and at last he felt the ropes
giving slightly he redoubled his efforts strand by strand the cords
parted he put all his efforts into one last attempt and to his great
joy he felt his hands separate he was partly free
but scarcely half his task was accomplished he had yet to discover the
secret of the hidden rooma room as he afterward learned which had
been built during slavery days to conceal the poor black men who were
escaping from the south
but now i have my hands to work with exulted mark
resting a bit after his strenuous labors he took a long drink of water
and attacked the ropes on his feet they were comparatively easy to
loosen and soon he stood up unbound
now for the secret panel he exclaimed for he was convinced that it
was by some such means that his captor had entered and left as has
already been explained mark knew on which side of his prison the
opening was likely to beit would be where the warning knocks had
sounded he began a minute inspection of that wall
but if mark hoped to speedily discover the secret he was doomed to
disappointment he went over every inch of the surface seemingly and
pressed on every depression or projection that met his eye as he
passed the candle flame along the wall
success did not reward him and as hour after hour passed and the
candle burned lower and lower mark began to despair
i must escape before the projectile leaves he murmured it will
never do to let them take that man with them under the impression that
they have me i must escape i will
once more he began the tiresome task of seeking the secret spring the
candle was spluttering in the socket now it would burn hardly another
minute desperately mark sought
at last just as the candle gave a dying gasp and flared brightly up
prior to going out the lad saw a small screw head he had not noticed
before it was sunk deep in a board
i will press that and see what happens he exclaimed
with a suddenness that was startling he found himself in total
darkness the candle had burned out but he had his finger on the
screw he pressed it with all his force
there was a rumbling sound in the darkness a movement as if some heavy
body had slid out of the way and mark felt a breath of air on his
cheeks then he saw a dim light
oh i am out i am out he cried joyously breathing a prayer of
thankfulness at his deliverance i am free i pushed on the right
spring and the panel slid back
he fairly leaped forward the morning light was streaming in through
the broken windows he saw himself in the old hall of the mansion at
the head of the stairs in a sort of anteroom the mantle of which
apartment had swung aside to give him egress from the secret chamber
through a hole in the wall he was free
but am i in time he cried it is morningand about ten oclock i
should judge i have been working to get free all night will i be in
time
he gave one last look behind at his prison and sprang down the rickety
stairs he had but one thoughtto reach home in time to unmask the
villain who was impersonating himto be in time to make the journey to
the moon
but it is several miles and i can not walk very fast murmured mark
i am too stiff and weak how can i do it
he thought of making his way to the nearest farm house and asking for
the loan of a horse and carriage but he looked so much like a tramp
that no farmer would lend him a horse
and i need to make speed he murmured
at that moment he heard a noise down the road it was a steady chug
chug like some distant motorboat but there was no water near at
hand
a motorcycle exclaimed mark some one is coming on a motorcycle
oh if i could only borrow it
he ran down into the road he could see the rider now to his joy it
was dick johnsonthe lad who had brought him the mysterious note
hi dick dick hold on cried mark
the lad on the motor gave one glance at the ragged figure that had
hailed him then he turned on more power to escape from what he thought
was a savage tramp
wait stop i want that motorcycle cried mark
well you are not going to get it yelled back dick i will send the
police after you
mark could not understand then a glance down at his ragged garments
showed him what was the matter
wait hold on dick he cried running forward i am mark sampson
i have had a terrible time i was captured by that mysterious man and
he is got my clothes i must get home quick
dick heard but scarcely understood however he comprehended that his
friend was in trouble and he wanted to help him he slowed up and
mark reached him
lend me your motorcycle dick begged mark i must get home in a
hurry to unmask a scoundrel i will leave your machine for you at our
house i will not hurt it i am in a hurry get off
somewhat dazed dick dismounted and mark climbed into the saddle he
began to pedal and then threw in the gasolene and spark the cycle
chugged off
i will leave it for you at our house mark called back i am going on a
trip to the moon and i do not want to be late
he was fast disappearing in a cloud of dust while dick gazing after
him remarked
well i always thought those fellows were crazy to go off in
projectiles and things like that and now i am sure of it going to the
moon well i only hope he does not take my motorcycle there
mark sped on turning the handle levers to get the last notch of speed
out of the cycle would he be in time
chapter xiii
a direful threat
perhaps washington white is shanghai rooster did not care to make the
trip to the moon or perhaps the fowl had not yet seen enough of this
earth at any rate when he flew from the projectile uttering loud
crows and landed some distance away he began to run back toward the
coop in the rear of the yard
cotch him cotch him yelled the colored man dat is a valuable
bird
we will get him when he goes in the coop said jack who found it
difficult to run and laugh at the same time
shall i fire my rifle off and scare him asked andy sudds
no you might kill him or scare him to death objected washington
come on mark and help cried jack looking toward the projectile
where a figure was peering from the glasscovered port of the main
cabin
but the figure whose hand was done up in voluminous bandages did not
come out and jack wondered the more at what he thought was a growing
strangeness on the part of his chum
jack followed by andy and washington raced off after the rooster
while the two professors somewhat amused rather chaffed at the delay
but afterward they were glad of it
just my luck muttered the bandaged one this delay comes at the
wrong time why do not they go on without that confounded rooster if we
stay here too long that fellow mark may get loose and spoil the whole
thing or jenkins may go and release him before the time set it would
be just like jenkins i have a good notion to start the projectile
myself i know how to operate the cardite motor only i suppose those
two professors are on guard in the engine room i will have to wait until
they catch that rooster i guess but i would like to wring his neck
the chase after the fowl was kept up
i have got him now cried jack a little later as the fowl evidently
now much exhausted ran into another fence corner where jack caught
him and shut him up in the coop in the projectile
you suttinly am de mos contraryminded specimen ob de chicken fambly
dat i eber seed observed washington breathing heavily for his run
had winded him
well are we all ready to start now asked professor henderson no
more live stock loose is there jack
i think not
where is mark was not he helping you catch the rooster
no he is inside shall i seal the door
yes and i will tell professor roumann that we are about to start all
ready for the moon trip
jack was pulling the steel portal toward him an eager face peering
from a port waited anxiously for the tremor which would indicate that
the projectile had left the earth in another moment they would be off
but what was that sound coming from down the highway a steady chug
chuga sort of roar as of a battery of rapidfire guns going off in
double relays and mingled with the explosions there was a voice
shouting
wait hold on do not go without me i am mark sampson do not start the
projectile
somebody must be in a mighty hurry on a motorcycle thought jack as
he paused a moment before fastening the door then the shouts came to
his ears
mark sampson he cried
again came the cry wait wait do not go without me you have got that
mysterious man on board
mark sampson murmured jack again that is his voice sure enough i
wondercan it be possiblethat manwith his head all bandaged up
his queer actionsii
words failed the youth throwing wide open the door he sprang out of
the projectile a moment later there dashed into the yard where the
great projectile rested a strange figure astride of a puffing
motorcycle the figure was torn and ragged and the nondescript
garments were covered with dust for mark had had a fall but there was
no mistaking the face that peered eagerly forward
jack cried the youth on the machine
mark ejaculated the lad who had sprung from the projectile what
has happened who is the fellow who has been masquerading as you
a scoundrel and a villain let me get at him and slamming on the
brakes as he shut off the power mark leaped from the motorcycle
stood it up against the projectile and clasped his chum by the hand
what is the matter asked professor henderson as he too ran out of
the annihilator what does that tramp want jack give him some
money and get back in here we ought to have started long ago he
looked at the ragged figure
this is not a tramp cried jack it is mark
mark i thought
there have been strange doings gasped the lad in tramp is garments
i have just escaped from being kept a prisoner where is the
mysterious man oh i am glad i arrived in time were you about to
start
that is what we were replied jack oh mark but i am glad to see you
again i did not know what to think you acted so strangeor rather
the fellow we thought was you had me guessing
good land a massy exclaimed washington white as he stood in the
doorway with andy sudds behind him am dere two marks what is up
anyhow
do not let that fellow get awaythe fellow who passed himself off as
me shouted mark lock him up there is some mystery about him that
must be explained he is a dangerous man to be at large
professor henderson turned back to enter the projectile jack advised
andy to get his gun ready with which to threaten the scoundrel in case
of necessity
at that instant there sounded a crash of glass and the whole front of
the big observation window in the side of the annihilator was smashed
to atoms a figure leapeda figure which no longer had its head
bandaged and whose arm was no longer in a slingthe figure of a man
the mysterious man who had held mark a prisoner
there he goes shouted jack catch him somebody andy where is your
gun
i will have it in a jiffy cried the hunter as he dashed back to get
it
but the man did not linger scrambling to his feet after his fall
caused by his leap from the broken window which he had smashed with a
sledge hammer as soon as he understood that his game was up he raced
out of the yard he turned long enough to shake his fist at the group
assembled around the projectile and then leaped away calling out some
words which they could not hear
let is take after him proposed mark
come on seconded jack
no let him go he is a desperate man and you came just in time to
unmask him said professor henderson he might harm you if you took
after him let him go he has not done much damage we can easily
replace the broken window but i can not understand what his object was
in disguising himself as mark he certainly looked like you mark
especially when he kept his face concealed why did he do it
he wanted to go to the moon in my place answered the former prisoner
of the deserted house
but why insisted jack
because i think he is crazy and he did not really know what he did
want but he certainly had me well concealed spoke mark i am free
now however and as soon as i get some decent clothes on i will go with
you to the moon i would not want the moon people to see me dressed this
way
how did it happen asked jack tell us all about it my but i
certainly have been puzzled since youor rather since the person we
thought was youcame back last night all bunged up give us the
story
i will give me a chance i guess that villain is gone for good andy
sudds came out with his gun and insisted on taking a look down the
road and around the premises the man was nowhere in sight
now we are in for another delay remarked jack ruefully as he gazed
at the smashed window it seems as if we would never get started for the
moon
oh yes we will declared professor henderson we have some extra
heavy plate glass in the shop and we can soon put in another
observation window
let is get right to work then proposed jack that man may come back
did you learn who he was mark
no he would not tell his name and he said he was doing this to get
revenge on us for some fancied wrong i can not imagine who he is but
let is work and talk at the same time i will tell you all that happened
to me which he did briefly
mark soon got rid of the tramp clothes and donned an extra suit which
had been packed in his trunk in the projectile then he helped replace
the broken window which in spite of their haste took nearly all the
rest of the day to put in place
shall we wait and start tomorrow asked jack when four oclock
came it will soon be dark
darkness will make no difference to us announced professor roumann
our cardite motor will soon take us out of the shadow of the earth
and we will be in perpetual sunshine until we reach the moon as we are
all ready we might as well start now
they all agreed with this and after a final inspection of the
projectile the travellers entered it and jack was once more about to
seal the big door
before he could do so there came riding into the yard on his
motorcycle which he had claimed that afternoon dick johnson
wait a minute he cried i have got a letter for you it is from that
man
whatanother thing to delay us cried jack but he called to
professor roumann not to start the motor and ran to take from dick the
letter which the lad held out
that same man who gave me the one for mark gave me this and he paid
me a half a dollar to bring it here said the boy
all right answered jack impatiently
he looked at the note it was addressed to the moon travellers and
considering that he was one the youth tore open the envelope in the
dim light of the fading day he read the bold handwriting
i have fixed you the letter began you will never get to the moon
i shall have my revenge you took my brother fred axtell to mars and
left him there i determined to get him back and to that end i
disguised myself as one of the boys and got aboard when we were
safely away from the earth i would have compelled you to go to mars
and rescue my brother but my plan has failed i will have my revenge
though you will never reach the moon even if you do get started
beware george the brother of fred axtell will avenge his fate
the brother of the crazy machinist gasped jack now i understand
his strange actions he is crazy toohe wanted to go to marshe says
we will never reach the moon say look here cried jack raising his
voice here is bad news that scoundrel has put some game up on us
maybe he is tampered with the machinery it will not be safe to start for
the moon until we have looked over everything carefully he says he is
fixed us and perhaps he has
from the projectile came hurrying the wouldbe moon travellers a vague
fear in their hearts
chapter xiv
off at last
in the gathering twilight professor henderson read slowly the note dick
had brought then he passed it to professor roumann the latter shook
his shaggy gray hair and murmured something in german
where did you meet the man asked jack of the young motorcyclist
about two miles down the road he was walking along sort of talking
to himself and i was afraid of him he called to me and offered me a
half a dollar to deliver this message i did not want to at first but
he said if i did not he would hurt me so i took it is it anything bad
we do not know yet replied mark
no that is the worst of it added professor roumann he has made a
threat but we can not tell whether or not he will accomplish it we are
in the dark he may have done some secret damage to our machinery and
it will take a careful inspection to show it
and will the inspection have to be made now asked jack
i think so answered professor henderson gravely it would not be
safe to start for the moon and have a breakdown before we got there we
must wait until morning to begin our trip
it will be the safest spoke the german and the boys in spite of
the fact that they were anxious to get under way were forced to the
same conclusion
then if we are going to camp here for the night proposed old andy
what is the matter with me and the boys having a hunt for that man
we have put up with enough from him and it is time he was punished if we
let him go on he will annoy us all the while if not now then after we
get back from the moon i am for giving him a chase and having him
arrested
he certainly deserves some punishment if only for the way he treated
mark was jack is opinion his chum having related how he was drugged
and kept a prisoner in the secret room and how he escaped in time to
unmask the villain
well said professor henderson after some thought it might not be
a bad plan to see if you could get that scoundrel put in some safe
place where he could make no more trouble for us i guess the lunatic
asylum is where he belongs though i can sympathize with him on account
of his brother but it was not our fault that the crazy machinist went
with us to mars he was a stowaway and went against our wishes and
when he got there he tried to injure us
then may mark andy and i see if we can find this man asked jack
yes but be careful not to get separated and do not run any risks
cautioned the professor mr roumann and i with the help of
washington will go carefully over all the machinery and every part of
the projectile to see if any hidden damage has been done but do not
stay out too late you had better notify the police they may be able
to give you some aid and i do not mind letting them know about it now
as we will soon be away from here because no matter if they do send
detectives or constables spying about now they can learn none of our
secrets
waiting only to partake of a hasty meal the two boys and the veteran
hunter set out andy with his gun over his shoulder and his sharp eyes
on the lookout for any sign of axtell though they hardly expected to
find him in the vicinity of the projectile
taking the road on which dick johnson said he had encountered the man
the two lads and andy proceeded making inquiries from time to time of
persons they met but no one had seen axtell and the insane man for
such he seemed to be appeared to have dropped out of sight
on into the village the searchers went and there they reported matters
to the chief of police telling him only so much as was necessary to
give him an understanding of the situation
i will send a couple of my best constables right out on the case said
the chief we have just appointed two new ones and i guess they will be
glad to arrest somebody
let them look out that this fellow does not drug them and carry them
away cautioned mark
oh i guess my constables can look out for theirselves spoke the
chief proudly
once more the trailers sallied forth to renew their search they
thought perhaps they might find their man lingering in the town but a
search through the principal streets did not disclose him and mark
proposed that they return to their home for the night as he was tired
and weary from his experience in the deserted house
as they were turning out of the town their attention was attracted by
a disturbance on the street just ahead of them a woman screamed and
men is voices were heard then came cries of police police
some one is in trouble exclaimed jack let is go see what it is
they broke into a run and as they approached they saw a crowd
quickly collect it seemed to center about a man who was being held by
two others though he struggled to get away
here what is the trouble the boys heard a constable ask as he
shouldered his way into the throng
this fellow tried to snatch this lady is purse and run away with it
explained one of the men who had grabbed the scoundrel stand still
you brute he shouted at him or i will shake you to pieces such
fellows as you ought to go to the whippingpost
i will take charge of him announced the officer who is he does any
one know
stranger in town i guess volunteered the other man who had helped
capture him need any help officer
no i guess i can manage him come along now and behave yourself or
i will use my club it has not been tried on any one yet
that is one of the new constables i guess said mark and jack
nodded
the crowd separated to allow the officer to take out his prisoner as
the latter walked forward in the grip of the constable he remarked in
a mild voice totally at variance with his bold act
why i only wanted a little change to pay my fare to the moon i am
going there to look for my brother
crazy as a loon said one of the men
or pretending that he is added the officer
mark cried jack pointing at the prisoner look
the man who held me captive gasped mark and he is wearing my
clothes yet but he is in custody now and we need not fear any more from
him
unless he gets away said jack
we will go tell the chief who he is and he will keep him safe suggested
mark and they hurried to headquarters reaching there just before the
prisoner was brought in the boys were assured by the chief that the
man who was evidently a dangerous lunatic would be kept where he
could do no harm he would be arraigned later on the serious charge of
attempted highway robbery as well as of being a dangerous lunatic at
large when the boys and andy got back they found the two professors
and washington still going over the machinery in detail
find anything wrong asked jack after they had told of the arrest of
axtell
no but we will have another look in the morning said mr henderson
then if we find nothing out of order i think we will take a chance
and start
a thorough inspection by all hands the next day did not disclose
anything wrong and a test of the motors and other machinery having
shown that it was in good working shape it was decided to leave the
earth
at last i think we are really going to get under way to the moon
said jack as he closed the big main door this time it was not
reopened all the stores and supplies were in place the two professors
were in the engine room washington white was in his galley getting
ready to serve the first meal in the air jack and mark were in the
pilot house ready to do whatever was necessary and anxious to feel the
thrill that would tell them the projectile had left the earth
all ready asked professor henderson
all ready replied his german assistant
then here we go announced the aged scientist
he pulled toward him the main starting lever of the cardite motor
while professor roumann opened the valve which admitted to the plates
and cylinders the mysterious force that was to send them on their way
elevate the bow called professor henderson
elevated it is answered the german as he turned a wheel which
directed the negative gravity force against the surface of the ground
and tilted up the nose of the annihilator as a skyrocket is slanted
in a trough before the fuse is ignited
throw over the switch directed mr henderson and the other
scientist with a quick motion snapped it into place amid a shower of
vicious electric sparks that hissed as when hot iron is thrust into
water
steer straight ahead called professor henderson to mark and jack
who were in the pilot house we will head for the moon later
straight ahead it is answered jack
there was a trembling to the great projectile up rose her sharp
pointed bow she swayed slightly in the air the trembling increased
the great cardite motor hummed and throbbed there was a crackling as
from a wireless apparatus
then with a rush and a roar the big steel car resembling an enormous
cigar soared away from the earth like some gigantic piece of
fireworks and shot toward the sky
we are off shouted mark
for the moon added jack
and the annihilator soared upward and onward while those in her
never dreamed of the fearful adventures that were to befall them ere
they would again be headed toward the earth
chapter xv
the shanghai makes trouble
remaining in the engine room long enough to see that all the motors and
apparatus were working smoothly professor henderson made his way to
the pilot house forward where mark and jack were in charge of the
steering gears the projectile could be started and stopped from there
as well as from the engine room once the motor was set going
well boys how does it feel to be in space once more asked the
scientist
fine answered mark but while i was shut up in that old house i
feared i would never have this chance again
it seems like old times again to be flying through space remarked
jack my but we are not making half the speed of which the projectile
is capable why we are only going about twenty miles a second and he
spoke as if that was a mere nothing
twenty miles is some speed observed mark
the earth goes around the sun at the rate of nineteen miles a second
or about seventyfive times as fast as the swiftest cannonball so you
see jack you are going some as the boys say
yes but we went much faster when we went to mars still no matter
how fast we travel you would never realize it inside here
this was true so well balanced was the projectile and so delicately
poised was the machinery that the terrifically fast rate of travel
rivalling that of the earth was no more noticed than we on this
globe notice our pace of nineteen miles a second around the sun
everything seems to be all right observed professor henderson as he
looked out of the plateglass window of the pilot house into a sea of
rolling mist which represented the ether for they had soon passed
through the atmosphere of the earth which scientists estimate to be
two hundred miles in thickness
are we going to move any faster than this asked jack who seemed
possessed of a speed mania
not right away replied mr henderson professor roumann wants to
thoroughly test the cardite motor first then when he finds that it
works all right we may go faster but we will be at the moon soon
enough as it is it is time we headed more directly on our proper way
though so i think i will ask mr roumann to step here and aid me in
getting the projectile on the right course you boys had better remain
also and learn how it is done you may need to know some time
i will call the professor here if he can leave the engine room said
mark and he found the german bending over some complicated apparatus
the scientist announced that the machines would run themselves
automatically for a while so he accompanied the lad back to the pilot
house
there consulting big charts of the heavens and by making some
intricate calculations which the boys partly understood the german
and mr henderson were able to locate the exact position of the moon
though that body was not then in sight being behind the earth
that ought to bring us there inside of a week announced mr
henderson as he fastened the automatic steering apparatus in place
the projectile will now be held on a straight course and i hope we
shall not have to change it
could anything cause us to swerve to one side asked jack
sure replied mark do not you remember how in the trip to mars we
nearly collided with the comet if we are in danger of hitting another
one of those things or even a meteor we will steer out of the way
will not we
of course i forgot about that admitted jack
yes declared professor roumann we will have to be on the lookout for
wandering meteors or other stray heavenly bodies but our instruments
will give us timely warning of them now i think we can leave the
projectile to herself while i make sure that all the machinery is
running smoothly you boys may stay here if you like though there
is not much to see
there was not it was totally unlike taking a trip on earth where the
evervarying scenery makes a journey pleasant there was no landscape
to greet the eye now it was even unlike a trip in a balloon for in
that sort of aircraft at least for a time a glimpse of the earth can
be had now there was nothing but a white blanket of mist to be seen
which rolled this way and that occasionally it was dispelled and the
full golden sunlight bathed the projectile the earth had long since
dropped out of sight for it required only a few seconds to put the
annihilator high up in a position where even the most intrepid
balloonist had never ventured
mark and jack sat for a few minutes in the pilothouse looking out
into the ether but they soon tired of seeing absolutely nothing
i wonder what we will do when we get to the moon asked jack of his
chum
why i suppose you will make a dive for a hatful of diamonds will not you
that is if you still believe that martian newspaper account
i sure do
the boys found the two professors busy adjusting some of the delicate
scientific instruments with which they expected to make observations on
the trip and after they reached the moon
what is your opinion professor roumann of the temperature at the
moon is surface asked mr henderson
i am in two minds about it was the reply a few years ago i see by
an astronomy lord rosse inferred from his observations that the
temperature rose at its maximum or about three days after full moon
far above that of boiling water
boiling water ejaculated mark wow that will not be very nice i
do not want to be boiled like a lobster
wait a moment cautioned mr roumann with a smile later lord
rosse is own investigations and those of langley threw some doubts on
this there is said to be no air blanket about the moon as there is
about the earth so that the moon loses heat as fast as it receives it
and it now seems more probable that the temperature never rises above
the freezing point of water just as is the case on our highest
mountains
that is better came from jack we can stand a low temperature more
easily than we can to be boiled eh jack
sure but i do not want to be frozen or boiled either if i can help
it guess i will wear my fur suit that we brought back from the north
pole with us
i agree with you professor roumann about the temperature announced
mr henderson so we must make up our minds to shiver rather than
melt but we are prepared for that
what about there being no air on the moon asked jack
oh we can manufacture our own oxygen said mark we can walk around
with an air tank on our shoulders as we did when we went beneath the
surface of the ocean now i guess
dinner am served in de dining car interrupted washington white his
black face grinning cheerfully he used to be a waiter in a pullman
and he was proud of it first call fo dinner he went on part ob
it am boiled part am roasted laik i done heah you talking bout jest
now and part am frozeddat is de ice cream he added hastily lest
there be a mistake about it
well that sounds good observed mark come on everybody and he
led the way to the dining cabin
they had not been at the table more than a few minutes and had begun
on the boiled part of the meal which was the soup when from the
engine room there came a curious whining noise as when an electric
motor slows up
what is that cried professor henderson jumping up from his seat in
alarm
something wrong in the engine room cried mr roumann
the two scientists followed by the boys hurried to where the various
pieces of apparatus were sending the projectile forward through space
already there was an appreciable slackening of speed
the cardite motor has stopped cried mr roumann something has
happened to it
can it be the result of the damage which that lunatic did asked mr
henderson
perhaps spoke jack if i had him here
we are falling shouted mark looking at an indicator which marked
their speed and motion
can not we start some other motor asked jack
at that instant from beneath the now silent cardite machine there came
a prolonged crow
my shanghai rooster shouted washington he am in dar
a second later the rooster scrambled out scratching vigorously grains
of corn were scattered about the motor started up again and the
projectile resumed its onward way
the rooster stopped it cried jack he went under it to get some
corn and he must have deranged one of the levers oh you old
shanghai you nearly gave us all heart disease
and the rooster crowed louder than before while his colored owner
shooed him out of the engine room the trouble was over speedily and
the annihilator was once more speeding toward the moon
chapter xvi
will it hit us
well for a troublemaker give me a rooster every time spoke jack
as after an examination of the machinery it was found that nothing
was out of order how do you think it happened professor henderson
it never could have happened except in just that way was the reply
of mr roumann underneath the motor where they are supposed to be
out of all reach are several selfadjusting levers they control the
speed and also by being moved in a certain direction they will shut
down the apparatus the rooster crawled beneath the machine an act
that i never figured on for i knew it was too small for any of us to
reach with our hands or arms even had we so desired but the
shanghai is feathers must have brushed against the levers and that
stopped the action of the cardite motor however i am glad it was no
worse
yes let is finish dinner now if everything is all right proposed
mark
how did the rooster get in here asked jack
i ispects dat is my fault answered washington i took him out ob his
coop fo a little exercise dis mawning and he run in heah
that explains it i think said mr roumann well washington do not
let it happen again we do not want to be dashed downward through space
all on account of a rooster
no indeedy i will lock him up good and tight arter dis promised the
colored man
they resumed the interrupted dinner discussing the possibility of what
might have happened and congratulating themselves that it did not take
place
it certainly seems like old times to be eating while travelling along
like a cannonball remarked jack i declare it gives me an
appetite
you did not need any retorted his chum but say maybe things do not
taste good to me after what i got while that fellow axtell had me a
prisoner jack i will have a little more of that cocoanut pie if you
do not mind
jack passed over the pastry and mark took a liberal piece then
washington brought in the ice cream which was frozen on board by means
of an ammonia gas apparatus the invention of professor henderson the
novelty of dining as comfortably as at home yet being thousands of
miles above the earth and at the same time speeding along like a
cannonball did not impress our friends as much as it had during their
trip to mars
well we are making a little better time now observed mark as he and
the others rose from the table and went to the engine room the gauge
shows that we are making twentyfive miles a second
we will soon go much faster announced professor roumann i have not
yet had a chance to test my cardite motor to its fullest speed and i
think i will do so i wish to see if it will equal my etherium machine
i will turn on the power gradually now and we will see what happens
how fast do you think it ought to send us along asked jack
oh perhaps one hundred and twentyfive miles a second you know we
went a hundred miles a second when we headed for mars i would not be
surprised if we made even one hundred and thirty miles a second with
the cardite
whew if we ever hit anything going like that exclaimed old andy
sudds
we would go right through it finished jack fervently the professor was
soon ready for the test slowly he shoved over the controlling lever
the cardite motor hummed more loudly like some great cat purring
louder snapped the electrical waves the air vibrated with the enormous
speed of the valve wheels and there was a prickling sensation as the
power flowed into the positive and negative plates by which the
projectile was moved through space
watch the hand of the speed indicator boys directed professor
roumann while professor henderson and i manipulate the motor call
out the figures to us for we must keep our eyes on the valves slowly
the speed indicator hand which was like that of an automobile
speedometer swept over the dial
fifty miles a second read off mark the two professors shoved the
levers over still more
seventyfive called jack
give it a little more of the positive current directed mr roumann
ninety miles a second read mark a few moments later
we are creeping up but we have not yet equalled our former speed
spoke mr henderson the motor was fairly whining now as if in
protest
one hundred and five miles announced jack
ha that is some better ejaculated the german i think we shall do
it once more he advanced the speed lever a notch
one hundred and thirty fairly shouted mark we are beating all
records
and we will go still farther beyond them cried mr roumann watch
the gauge boys
to the last notch went the speed handle there was a sharp crackling
snapping sound as if the metal of which the motor was composed was
strained to the utmost yet it held together
the hand of the dial quivered it hung on the one hundred and thirty
mark for a second as if not wanting to leave it and then the steel
pointer swept slowly on in a circle past point after point
one hundred and thirtyfiveone hundred and forty whispered jack
as if afraid to speak aloud the two professors did not look up from
the motor they looked at the oil and lubricating cups already the
main shaft was smoking with the heat of friction
look look whispered mark hoarsely
one hundred and fiftythree miles a second exclaimed jack you have
done it professor roumann
yes i have spoke the german with a sigh of satisfaction that is
faster than mortal man ever travelled before and i think no one will
ever equal our speed we have broken all recordseven our own now i
will slow down but we must do it gradually so as not to strain the
machinery
he slipped back the speed lever notch by notch the hand of the dial
began receding but it still marked one hundred and twenty miles a
second
suddenly above the roar and hum of the motor there sounded the voice
of andy
professor he shouted we are heading right toward a big black
stone is that the moon
the moon no we are not half way there said mr henderson are you
sure andy
sure yes i saw it from the window in the pilothouse we are
shooting right toward it
look to the motor and i will see what it is directed mr henderson to
his friend followed by the boys he hurried to the steering tower his
worst fears were confirmed
speeding along with a swiftness unrivalled even by some stars the
projectile was lurching toward a great black heavenly body it is a
meteor an immense meteor cried professor henderson and it is coming
right toward us
will it hit us gasped mark and jack together
i do not know we must try to avoid it boys notify professor roumann
at once we are in grave danger
chapter xvii
turning turtle
together mark and jack leaped for the engine room their faces showed
the fear they felt even before they reached it they realized that at
the awful speed at which they were travelling and the fearful velocity
of the meteor there might be a crash in midair which would destroy
the projectile and end their lives
i wonder if we can steer clear of it gasped jack
if it is possible the professor will do it responded his chum
the next instant they were in the engine room where mr roumann was
bending over the cardite motor
shut off the power yelled jack
we are going to hit a meteor gasped mark
the german looked up with a startled glance
slow down he repeated it is impossible to slow down at once we
are going ninety miles a second he pointed to the speed gauge
then there is going to be a fearful collision cried jack and he
blurted out the fact of the nearness of the heavenly wanderer
so exclaimed professor roumann dot is bat ferry bat and he
lapsed into the broken language that seldom marked his almost perfect
english then murmuring something in his own tongue he leaped away
from the motor calling to the boys
slow it down gradually keep pulling the speed lever toward you i
will set in motion the repelling apparatus and go to help professor
henderson steer out of the way it is our only chance
mark and jack took their places beside the cardite motor which was
still keeping up a fearful speed though not so fast as at first to
stop it suddenly would mean that the cessation of strain could not all
be diffused at once and serious damage might result
the only way was to come gradually down to the former speed and while
mark kept his eyes on the indicator jack pulled the lever toward him
notch by notch
she is down to seventyfive miles a second whispered mark they were
as anxious now to reduce speed as they had been before to increase it
meanwhile professor roumann had set in motion a curious bit of
apparatus designed to repel stray meteors or detached bits of comets
as is well known bodies floating in space away from the attraction of
gravitation attract or repel each other as does a magnet or an
electrically charged object
acting on this law of nature professor roumann had with the aid of
mr henderson constructed a machine which when a negative current of
electricity was sent into it would force away any object that was
approaching the annihilator in a few moments the boys at the
cardite motor heard the hum the throb and crackling that told them
that the repelling apparatus was at work
but would it act in time or would the meteor prove too powerful for
it and if it did would the two scientists be able to steer the
swiftly moving projectile out of the way of the big black stone as
the old hunter called it
these were questions that showed on the faces of the two lads as they
bent over the motor
we are only going fifty miles a second now whispered jack
mark nodded his head can not you pull the lever over faster he asked
i do not dare replied his chum there was nothing to do but to wait
and gradually slow up the projectile as much as possible the boys
could hear the professors in the pilothouse shifting gears valves and
levers to change the course of the projectile andy sudds and
washington white with fear on their faces looked into the engine
room waiting anxiously for the outcome
habhab we hit it yet asked washington moving his hands nervously
i reckon not or we would know it said the hunter
no not yet answered jack in a low voice how much are we making
now mark
only thirty a second
good she is coming down
hardly had he spoken than there sounded a noise like thunder or the
rushing of some mighty wind the projectile which was trembling
throughout her length from the force of the motor shivered as though
she had plunged into the unknown depths of some mighty sea the roaring
increased mark and jack looked at each other washington white fell
upon his knees and began praying in a loud voice old andy grasped his
gun as though to say that even though on the brink of eternity he
was ready
then with a scream as of some gigantic shell from a thousandinch
rifle something passed over the annihilator something that shook
the great projectile like a leaf in the wind and then the scream died
away and there was silence for a moment no one spoke and then jack
whispered hoarsely
we have passed it
yes added mark we are safe now
by golly i knowed we would fairly yelled washington leaping to his
feet i knowed dat no old meteor could kerflumox us perfesser
henderson he done jumped our boat ober it laik a hunter jumps his boss
ober a fence golly i ise feeling better now
how did you avoid it asked mark of the professor
with the help of the repelling machine and by changing our course but
we did it only just in time it was an immense meteor much larger than
at first appeared and it was blazing hot had it struck us there
would have been nothing left of us or the projectile either but star
dust but we managed to pass beneath it and now we are safe
they congratulated each other on their lucky escape and then busied
themselves about various duties aboard the aircraft the rest of the
day was spent in making minor adjustments to some of the machines
oiling others and in planning what they would do when they reached the
moon
in this way three days and nights passed mainly without incident they
slept well on board the annihilator which was speeding so swiftly
through spaceslept as comfortably as they had on earth each hour
brought them nearer the moon and they figured on landing on the
surface of that wonderful and weird body in about three days more
it was on the morning of the fourth day when as mark and jack were
taking their shift in the engine room that jack happened to glance
from the side observation window which was near the cardite motor
what he saw caused him to cry out in surprise
i say mark look here there is the moon over there we are not heading
for it at all
by jove you are right agreed his chum we are off our course
we must tell professor henderson cried jack i will do it you stay
here and watch things
a few seconds later a very much alarmed youth was rapidly talking to
the two scientists who were in the pilothouse
some unknown force must have pulled us off our course jack was
saying the moon is away off to one side of us
to his surprise instead of being alarmed mr roumann only smiled
it is true insisted jack
of course it is agreed mr henderson we can see it from here
jack and he pointed to the observation window from which could be
noticed the moon floating in the sky at the same time the sun was
shining a phenomenon which is often visible on the earth early in the
morning at certain of the moon is phases
will we ever get there asked jack
of course replied mr roumann you must remember jack that the
moon is moving at the same time we are had i headed the projectile for
luna and kept it on that course she would by the time we reached
her been in another part of the firmament and we would have overshot
our mark so instead i aimed the annihilator at a spot in the
heavens where i calculated the moon would be when we arrived there
and if i am not mistaken we will reach there at the same time and
drop gently down on luna
oh is that it asked the lad much relieved
that is it replied mr henderson and that is why we seem to be
headed away from the moon her motion will bring her into the right
position for us to land on when the time comes
then i would better go tell mark said the lad he is quite worried he
soon explained matters to his chum and together they discussed the
many things necessary to keep in mind when one navigates the heavens
that day saw several thousand more miles reeled off on the journey to
the moon and that evening or rather what corresponded to evening for
it was perpetual daylight they began to make their preparations for
landing their wonderful journey through space was nearing an end
i guess that crazy axtell fellow was only joking when he said we would
never reach the moon ventured jack nothing has happened yet
only the meteor said mark and he could not know about that i guess
he did not get a chance to damage any of the machinery
no we seem to be making good time went on his chum i think i will
go and
jack did not finish his sentence instead he stared at one of the
instruments hanging from the walls of the engine room it was a sort of
barometer to tell their distance from the earth and it swung to and
fro like a pendulum now the instrument was swinging out away from the
wall to which it was attached further and further over it inclined
jack felt a curious sensation mark put his hand to his head
i feelfeel dizzy he exclaimed what is the matter
something has happened cried jack
the instrument swung over still more some tools fell from a work
bench and landed on the steel floor with a crash the boys were
staggering about the engine room unable to maintain their balance
there came cries of fear from the galley where washington white was
rattling away amid his pots and pans andy sudds was calling to some
one and from the pilothouse came the excited exclamations of
professors henderson and roumann
we are turning turtle suddenly yelled jack the projectile is
turning over in the air something has gone wrong perhaps this is the
revenge of that crazy man and as he spoke he fell over backward
mark following him while the annihilator was turned completely over
and seemed to be falling down into unfathomable depths
chapter xviii
at the moon
confusion reigned aboard the annihilator it had turned completely
over and was now moving through space apparently bottom side up of
course being cigar shaped this did not make any difference as far as
the exterior was concerned but it did make a great difference to those
within
the occupants of the great shell had fallen and slid down the rounded
sides of the projectile and were now standing on what had been the
ceiling objects that were not fast had also followed them scattering
all about some narrowly missing hitting our friends of course the
machinery was now in the air over the heads of the travellers
this was one of the most serious phases of the accident for the great
cardite motor was built to run while in the other position and when it
was turned upside down it immediately stopped and the projectile
deprived of its motive power at once began falling through space
what has happened what caused it cried mark as he crawled over to
where jack sat on the ceiling with a dazed look on his face
i do not know something went wrong here comes professor henderson and
mr roumann we will ask them
the two scientists were observed approaching from the pilothouse they
walked along what had been the ceiling and when they came to the
engine room they had to climb over the top part of the door frame
what is wrong asked jack
our center of gravity has become displaced answered mr henderson
the gravity machine has either broken or some one has been tampering
with it did either of you boys touch it
no indeed cried mark and his chum echoed his words
i wonder if washington could have meddled with it went on the
scientist
at that moment the colored cook came along making his way cautiously
into the engine room he was an odd sight bits of carrots turnips and
potatoes were in his hair while from one ear dangled a bunch of
macaroni and his clothes were dripping wet
my kitchen done turned upside down on me wailed washington and a
whole kettle ob soup emptied on my head oh golly what happened
the aged scientist looked toward the german the latter was gazing up
at the motionless cardite motor over his head
there is but one way he answered we must restore our centre of
gravity to where it was before then the projectile will right
herself
can it be done asked mark
it will be quite an undertaking but we must attempt it bring some
tables and chairs so i can stand up and reach the equilibrium
machine
from where they had fallen to the ceiling which was now the floor
jack and mark brought tables and chairs and made a sort of stepladder
on this professor roumann mounted and at once began the readjusting of
the centre of gravity
it was hard work for he had to labor with his arms stretched up in the
air and any one who has even put up pictures knows what that means
the muscles are unaccustomed to the strain the german scientist
though a strong man had to rest at frequent intervals
we are falling rapidly announced jack in a low voice as he looked
at the height gauge
i am doing all i can answered mr roumann i think i will soon be
able to right the craft
he labored desperately but he was at a disadvantage for the
annihilator was not now moving smoothly through space with the
stopping of the motor she was falling like some wobbly balloon swaying
hither and thither in the ether currents
but professor roumann was not one to give up easily he kept at his
task aided occasionally by professor henderson and by the boys
whenever they could do anything
finally the german cried out
ah i have discovered the trouble it is that scoundrel axtell see
and reaching into the interior of the machine he pulled out a small
magnet to it was attached a card on which was written
i told you i would have my revenge it was signed with axtell is name
this was the dastardly plot he evolved said professor roumann he
slipped this magnet into the equilibrium machine knowing that in time
it would cause a deflection of the delicate needles and so shift the
centre of gravity he must have done this as a last resort and to
provide for his revenge in case we discovered him on board after we
started it was a cruel revenge for had i not discovered it we would
soon all be killed
is the machine all right now asked jack
it will be in a few minutes here take this magnet and put it as far
away from the engine room as possible
it was the work of but a few minutes now that the disturbing element
was removed to readjust the gravity machine and mr roumann called
look out now everybody we are going to turn right side up again
as he spoke he turned a small valve wheel there was a clanging of
heavy ballast weights which slid down their rods to the proper places
then like some great fish turning over in the water the annihilator
turned over in the ether and was once more on her proper keel if such
a shaped craft can be said to have a keel
of course the occupants of the space ship went slipping and sliding
back even as they had fallen ceilingward before but they were
prepared for it and no one was hurt from the galley came a chorus of
cries as pots and pans once more scattered about washington but there
was no more soup to spill
as soon as the annihilator was righted the cardite motor began to
work automatically and once more the projectile with the seekers of
the moon was shooting through space at their former speed they had
lost considerable distance but it was easy to make it up
well that was an experience remarked jack as he and his chum
began picking up the tools and other objects that were scattered all
about by the change in equilibrium
i should say yes agreed mark i am glad it did not happen at dinner
time that fellow axtell is a fiend to think of such a thing
indeed he is but we are all right now though it did feel funny to be
turned upside down
an inspection of the projectile was made but they could discover no
particular damage done she seemed to be moving along the same as
before and except for the upsetting of things in the storeroom it
would hardly have been known an hour later that a dreadful accident
was narrowly averted
washington made more soup and soon had a fine meal ready over which
the travellers discussed their recent experience
and when do you think we will arrive asked jack of mr henderson
we ought to be at the moon inside of two days now we have not made
quite the speed we calculated on but that does not matter i think we
will go even more slowly on the remainder of the trip as i wish to
take some scientific observations
yes and so do i added mr roumann i think if we make fifteen
miles a second from now on we will be moving fast enough
accordingly the cardite motor was slowed down and the projectile shot
through space at slightly reduced speed while the two scientists made
several observations and did some intricate calculating about ether
pressure the distance of heavenly bodies and other matters of interest
only to themselves
it was on the afternoon of the third day following the turning turtle
of the annihilator that mark who was looking through a telescope in
the pilothouse called out i say jack look here
what is the matter asked his chum
why we are rushing right at the moon i can see the mountains and
craters on it as plain as though we were but five miles away
then we must be nearly there observed jack let is tell the others
mark
they hurried to inform the two professors who at once left their
tables of figures and entered the steering chamber then after gazing
through the glass mr henderson announced friends we will land on
the moon in half an hour get ready
are we really going to be walking around the moon inside of thirty
minutes asked mark
i do not know about walking around on it answered the german we
first have to see if there is an atmosphere there for us to breathe
and whether the temperature is such as we can stand but the
annihilator will soon be there
the speed of the cardite motor was increased and so rapidly did the
projectile approach luna that glasses were no longer needed to
distinguish the surface of the moon
there she floated in space a great silent ball but not like the
earth pleasantly green with lakes and rivers scattered about in
verdant forests no for the moon presented a desolate surface to the
gaze of the travellers great rugged mountain peaks arose all about
immense caverns that seemed hundreds of miles deep the surface was
cracked and seamed as if by a moonquake silence and terrible
loneliness seemed to confront them
maybe it is better on some other part of the surface said jack in a
low voice
perhaps agreed mark it is certainly not inviting there
nearer and nearer they came to the moon it no longer looked like a
great sphere for they were so close that their vision could only take
in part of the surface and it began to flatten out as the earth does
to a balloonist
and the nearer they came to it the more rugged the more terrible the
more desolate did it appear would they be able to find a place to
land or would they go hurtling down into some awful crater or be
dashed upon the sharp peak of some mountain of the moon
it was a momentous question and anxious were the faces of the two
professors
mr henderson if you will undertake to steer to some level place i
will take charge of the motor suggested mr roumann i will
gradually reduce the speed and get the repelling machine in readiness
so as to render our landing gentle
very well responded the aged scientist as he grasped the steering
wheel
the progress of the annihilator was gradually checked more and more
slowly it approached the moon the mountains seemed even higher now
and the craters deeper
what a terrible place murmured jack i should not want to live
there
me either said mark
can you see a place to land called professor roumann through the
speakingtube from the engine room to the steering tower
yes we seem to be approaching a fairly level plateau was mr
henderson is reply
very well then i will start the repelling machine
the cardite motor was stopped the projectile was now being drawn
toward the moon by the gravity force of the dead ball that once had
been a world like ours slowly and more slowly moved the great
projectile
there was a moment of suspense mr henderson threw over the steering
wheel the annihilator moved more slowly then came a gentle shock
the dishes in the galley rattled and there was the clank of machinery
the shanghai rooster crowed
we are on the moon at last cried jack peering from an observation
window at the rugged surface outside
yes and now to see what it is like added mark we will go outside
and
wait cautioned professor roumann first we must see if we can
breathe on the moon and whether the temperature will support life i
must make some tests before we venture out of the projectile
chapter xix
torches of life
the natural inclination of the boys to rush out on the surface of the
moon to see what it was like was checked by the words of caution from
professor roumann
do you think it would be dangerous to venture outside the projectile
asked jack as he looked from the window and noted the rugged uneven
surface of the moon
very much so was the answer according to most astronomers there
is absolutely no air on the moon also no moisture and the temperature
is either very high or around the freezing point we must find out what
it is
how can we inquired mark
i will soon show you went on the german professor henderson will
you kindly assist me
when it had been decided to come to the moon in quest for the field of
diamonds certain changes had been made in the annihilator to fit it
for new conditions that might be met one of these consisted of an
aperture in the two sides of the projectile permitting certain delicate
instruments to be thrust out so that the conditions they indicated
could be read on dials or graduated scales from within
we will first make a test of the temperature said mr roumann as
that will be the easiest accordingly a thermometer was put outside
and those in the aircraft anxiously watched the red column of spirits
the temperature was marked as seventyfive inside the annihilator
but the thermometer had not been outside more than a second before
it began falling
good exclaimed mr henderson as he noted it the temperature is
going down i would rather have it too cold than too hot we can stand a
minus fifty of cold better than two hundred and twelve of heat we have
fur garments with us
it is still going down remarked jack as he saw the red column drop
down past the thirty mark
below freezing added mark
the spirits fell in the tube until they touched twentyeight degrees
and there they remained
twentyeight degrees remarked professor henderson that is not so
bad at least we can stand that if we are warmly clad
yes but it will be colder tonight said jack for they had landed
on the moon in bright sunlight
tonight questioned the german scientist with a smile
yes it is always colder when the sun goes down went on the lad
you have forgotten one thing said mr henderson with a smile at his
young protege you must remember jack that the nights and days here
are each fourteen days longthat is fourteen of our days
how is that asked jack
why broke in mark who was a trifle better student than was his
chum do not you remember that the moon rotates on its axis once a
month or in about twentyeight days to be exact and so half of that
time is day and half night just as on our earth when it revolves on
its axis in twentyfour hours half the time is day and half the time
is night
sure i ought to have remembered declared jack
mark is right added mr henderson and as we have most fortunately
arrived on the moon at the beginning of the long day we will have
fourteen days of sunshine during which we may expect the temperature
to remain at about twentyeight degrees but now about the atmosphere
we will test that directly went on the german it will take some
time longer though
various instruments were brought forth and thrust out of the opening in
the side of the projectile which opening was so arranged that it was
closed hermetically while the instruments were put forth then the
readings of the dials or scales were taken and computations made in
fact some of what corresponded to the moon is atmosphere was secured in
a hollow steel cup and brought inside the annihilator for analysis
well remarked professor roumann as he bent over a test tube the
contents of which he had put through several processes i am afraid we
cannot breathe on the moon
can not breathe on it gasped jack then we can not go out and walk
around it
i did not say that resumed the german with a smile i said we
could not breathe the moon is atmosphere in fact there is nothing there
that we would call atmosphere there is absolutely no oxygen and there
are a number of poisonous gases that would instantly cause death if
inhaled
then how are we to get out and hunt for those diamonds professor
went on jack gee whiz if i would known that i would not have come this
is tough luck
maybe the professor can suggest a way out of the difficulty boys
spoke mr henderson it certainly would be too bad if after our
perilous trip we could not get out of our cage and walk around the
moon
i think perhaps i can discover a way so that it will be safe to
venture forth said mr roumann but i must first conduct some
further experiments in the meanwhile suppose you boys get out some
furlined garments for though it is only twentyeight degrees we
will need to be well clad after the time spent inside this warm
projectile
it does look as if he expected to get us out remarked jack as he
and his chum went to where andy sudds was
yes you will get a chance to pick up diamonds after all jack that is
if there are any here
of course there are diamonds you wait and see and then with the
help of the old hunter they took from the storeroom their fur
garments
it was half an hour before the warm clothes were sorted out and then
the boys went back to where the two professors were
well asked jack cautiously can we go outside
i think so answered the german cheerfully but you must always be
careful to carry one of these with you and he handed to each of the
boys a steel rod about two feet long at the end of which was a small
iron box with perforations in the sides and top
what is this asked jack it looks like a magician is wand
and that is exactly what it is said mr henderson as there is no
atmosphere fit to breathe on the moon we have been forced to make our
own boys you each hold what may be called torches of life to venture
out without them would mean instant death by suffocation or poison
and will these save our lives asked mark
yes said mr roumann in the iron boxes on those rods are certain
chemicals rich in oxygen and other elements which when brought in
contact with the gases on the moon will dispel a cloud of air about
whoever carries themair such as we find on our earth so boys be
careful never to venture out without the torches of life i had them
prepared in anticipation of some such emergency as this and all that
was necessary was to put in the chemicals this i have done and now
if you wish you may go out and stroll about the moon
chapter xx
on the edge of a crater
there was a little hesitation after professor roumann had spoken even
though he assured them all that it would be safe to venture out on the
surface of the moon with its chilling temperature and its poisonous
atmosphere if such it can be termed there was an uncanny feeling
about stepping forth into the midst of the desolation that was on every
side
for it was desolateterribly so not a sound broke the stillness
there was no lifeno motionas far as could be seen not a tree or
shrub relieved the rugged monotony of the landscape it was like a dead
world
and to think that people may have once lived here observed jack in
a low voice
yes and to think that there may be people on the other side of the
moon even now added mark we must take a look if it is possible
well remarked mr henderson after a while are we going out and
see what it is like or not
of course we are said jack come on mark i am not afraid
me either do we have to do anything to the torches to make them
operate professor roumann
merely press this lever and the scientist showed them where there
was one in the handle of the steel rod as soon as that is pressed it
admits a liquid to the chemicals and the oxygen gas is formed rising
all around you like a protecting vapor after that it is automatic
how long will the supply of chemical last inquired jack
each one is calculated to give out gas for nearly two weeks was the
reply possibly for a little longer but come i want to see how they
work here is your lifetorch professor henderson and there is one
for you too andy and washington
 iscuse me exclaimed the colored man hastily as he started back
toward the kitchen
why what is the matter asked jack do not you want to go out and
walk around the moon and pick up diamonds
diamonds am all right answered washington but i jest done fogot
dat i is not fed my shanghai rooster today and i ispects he is mighty
hungry you folks go on out and pick up a few obde sparklers and when
i gits de shanghai fed i will prognosticate mysef inter conjunction wif
you all
you mean you will join us asked mark
dat is what i means suah
why i do believe washington is afraid cried jack jokingly
askeered who is afraid retorted the colored man boldly did not i
done tole you dat i got to feed my rooster heah him crowing now you
all go long and i will meet you later and with that washington
disappeared quickly
well he will soon pluck up courage and come out declared professor
henderson let him go now and we will go out and see what it is like on
the moon
i hope we find those diamonds murmured jack and mark smiled
in order not to admit the poisonous gases into the projectile it was
decided to leave the annihilator and return to it by means of a double
door forming a sort of air lock it was similar to the water lock used
on the submarine that is the adventurers entered a chamber built in
between the two steel walls of their craft the interior door was then
sealed shut automatically next the outer door was opened and they
could step directly to the surface of the moon and into the deadly
atmosphere
well are we all ready asked mr roumann as he picked up one of the
chemical torches
i guess so responded andy sudds who had his gun with him i hope i
see some game i have not had a shot in a long while
you are not likely to up here spoke mr henderson game is scarce on
the moon unless it is some of that green cheese washington talked
about
they entered the air lock and fastened the door behind them then
professor roumann pressed on the lever that swung open the outer
portal
hold your torches close to your head he called the moon atmosphere
may be too strong for us at first until we create a mist of oxygen
about us
out upon the surface of the moon they stepped probably the first earth
beings so to do though they had evidence that the inhabitants of mars
had preceded them
for a moment they all gasped for breath but only for a moment then
the gas began to flow from the lifetorches and they could breathe as
well as they had done while in the projectile or while on the earth
well if this is not great cried jack gazing about him
it certainly beats anything i ever saw came from mark
wonderful wonderful murmured professor henderson we will be able
to gain much valuable scientific knowledge here professor roumann we
must at once begin our observations
i agree with you spoke the german
andy sudds said nothing he was looking around for a sight of game
with his rifle in readiness but not a sign of life met his eager eyes
once they were outside the projectile it was even more desolate than it
had seemed when they looked from the observation windows it was
absolutely still not a breath of wind fanned their cheeks for where
there is no air to be heated and cooled there could be no wind which is
caused by the differences of temperature of the air the cold rushing
in to fill the vacuum caused by the rising of the hot vapors clad in
their furlined garments which effectually defied the cold the
adventurers stepped out
over the rugged ground they went gazing curiously about them it was
like being in the wildest part of the canadian rocky mountains of our
earth and in fact the surface of the moon was not unlike the
mountainous and hilly sections of the earth there were no long ranges
of rugged peaks though but rather scattered pinnacles and deep
hollows great craters adjoining immense towering steeples of rocks
with comparatively level ground in between
the lifetorches worked to perfection as our friends carried them
there arose about their bodies a cloud of invisible vapor which
however was as great a protection from the poisonous gases as a coat
of mail would have been
this is great exclaimed jack it is much better than to have to put
on a divingsuit and carry a cylinder of oxygen or compressed air about
on our shoulders
they strolled away from the projectile and gazed back at it nothing
movednot a sound broke the stillness there was only the blazing
sunlight which however did not seem to warm the atmosphere much for
it was very chilly on every side were great rocks rugged and broken
with here and there immense fissures in the surface of the moon
fissures that seemed miles and miles long
well here is where i look for diamonds called jack as he stepped
boldly out followed by mark let is see who will find the first
sparkler
all right agreed his chum and they strolled away together slightly
in advance of the two professors and andy who remained together the
scientist discussing the phenomena on every side and the hunter looking
in vain for something to shoot but he had come to a dead world
almost before they knew it jack and mark had gone on quite some
distance though they were not aware of it at that moment it was much
easier to walk on the moon than it was on the earth for they weighed
only one sixth as much and the attraction of gravitation was so much
less
but suddenly jack remembered that curious fact and stooping he
picked up a stone he cast it from him at the same time uttering a
yell
what is the matter called mark
look how far i fired that rock shouted jack talk about it being
easy why i believe i could throw a mile if i tried hard
it goes six times as far as it would on the earth spoke his chum
and we can also jump six times as far
then let is try that proposed jack there is a nice level place over
there come on i will wager that i can beat you
done agreed mark and they hurried to the spot their very walking
being much faster than usual
i will go first proposed jack and you see if you can come up to me
he poised himself on a little hummock of rock balanced himself for a
moment and then hurled himself through space
prepared as he was in a measure for something strange he never
bargained for what happened it was as if he had been fired from some
catapult of the ancient romans through the air he hurtled like some
great flying animal covering fifty feet from a standing jump
say that is great yelled mark here i come and i will beat
he did not finish for a cry of horror came from jack
i am going to fall into a cratera bottomless pit i am on the edge of
it yelled the lad who had jumped
and with horrorstricken eyes mark saw his chum disappear from sight
beyond a pile of rugged rocks toward which he had leaped the last
glimpse mark had was of the lifetorch which jack held up in the air
close to his head
jackin a crater gasped mark as he ran forward holding his own
lifetorch close to his mouth and nose
chapter xxi
washington sees a ghost
advancing by leaps and bounds and getting over the ground in a manner
most surprising mark soon found himself on the edge of the great
yawning crater into which his chum jack had started to slide i say
started for fortunately the lad had been saved from death but by a
narrow margin
as mark gazed down into the depths which seemed fathomless and which
were as black as night he saw his friend clinging to a rocky
projection on the side of the extinct volcano jack had managed to
grasp a part of the rough surface as he slid down it after his reckless
jump he looked up and saw mark
oh mark can not you save me he gasped call professor henderson
i will get you up do not worry called mark as confidently as he
could hold tight jack what has become of your lifetorch
i have it here by me i did not drop it and it is on a piece of the
rock near my head otherwise i could not breathe oh this place is
fearfully deep i guess it has not any bottom
now keep still and do not think about that save your strength hold
fast and i will get you up
but having said that much mark was not so sure how next to proceed
it was going to be no easy task to haul up jack and that without ropes
or other apparatus another matter that added to the danger was the
necessity of keeping the lifetorch close to one is face in order to
prevent death by the poisonous gases
mark is first impulse was to hasten back and call the two professors
but he looked over the desolate landscape and could not see them and
he feared that if he went away jack might slip and fall into the
unknown depths of the crater
i have got to get him out alone decided mark but how can i do it
he crawled cautiously nearer to the edge of the extinct volcano and
looked down a few loose stones dislodged by his weight rattled down
the sides
look out cried jack quickly or you will fall too
i will be careful answered mark and then he drew away out of danger
with a queer feeling about his heart which was beating furiously mark
had hoped to be able to make his way down the side of the crater to
where his chum was and help him up but a look at the steep sides and
the uncertain footing afforded by the loose rocks of lavalike
formation showed that this could not be done
i have got to think of a different scheme decided mark and spurred
on by the necessity of acting quickly if he was to save jack he fairly
forced his brain to work for he saw by the strained look on his chum is
face that jack could not hold out much longer
i have it cried mark at length my fur coat i can cut it into
strips of hide and make a rope then i can lower it down to jack and
haul him up
he did not think for the moment of the cold he would feel when he
stripped off the fur garment and when it did come to him in a flash he
never hesitated
after all i have often been out without an overcoat on cold days he
said to himself i guess i can stand it for a while and when jack is
up i can run back to the projectile and keep warm that way
to think was to act and mark laid down his lifetorch to take off the
big fur coat the next instant he had toppled over almost in a faint
and had he not fallen so that his head was near the small perforated
box on the end of the steel rod whence came the lifegiving gas the
lad might have died
he had forgotten for the instant the necessity of always keeping the
torch close to his face to prevent the poisonous gases of the moon from
overpowering him mark soon revived while lying on the ground and
rising with his torch in his hand he looked about him
i have got to have my two hands to work with he mused and yet i have
got to hold this torch close to my face say a fellow ought to have
three hands if he is going to visit the moon what can i do
in an instant a plan came to him he thrust the pointed end of the
steel rod in the crevice of some rocks and it stood upright so that
the perforated box of chemicals was on a level with his face
there said mark aloud i guess that will work i can use both my
hands now the plan was a good one next taking off his coat the lad
proceeded to cut it into strips working rapidly he called to jack
occasionally bidding him keep up his courage i will soon have you
out he said cheeringly
in a few minutes mark had a long stout strip of hide and taking his
lifetorch with him he advanced once more to the edge of the crater
he stuck the torch in between some rocks as before and looked down at
jack
ii can not hold on much longer gasped the unfortunate lad hurry
mark
all right i am going to haul you up now can you hold on with one hand
long enough to slip the loop of this rope over your shoulders
i guess so but where did you get a rope
i made itcut up my fur coat
but you will freeze
oh i guess not here it comes jack get ready
mark lowered the hide rope to his chum the latter who managed to get
one toe on a small projecting rock while he held on with his right
hand used his left to adjust the loop over his shoulders and under his
arms
are you all ready asked mark
yes but can you pull me up
sure i am six times as strong as when on the earth hold steady now
and keep the torch close to your face
mark had placed some pieces of his fur coat under the rope where it
passed over the edge of the mouth of the crater to prevent the jagged
rocks from cutting the strips of hide
here you come he cried to jack and he began to haul taking care to
keep his own head near his torch which was stuck upright mark had
spoken truly when he said he possessed much more than his usual
strength any one who has tried to haul up a person with a rope from a
hole and with no pulleys to adjust the strain of the cable knows what
a task it is but to mark on the moon it was comparatively easy
hand over hand he pulled on the hide rope until with a final heave he
had jack out of his perilous position he had pulled him up from the
mouth of the crater and the thick fur coat jack wore had prevented the
sharp rocks from injuring him in another moment he stood beside mark
a trifle weak and shaky from his experience but otherwise unhurt
how did you happen to go down there asked mark
not from choice i assure you answered jack i could not see the
crater when i jumped as it was hidden by some rocks and i was into it
before i knew it but do not stand talking here put on my coat i do not
need it i am warm
i will not i am not a bit cold but we may as well get back to the
projectile for they will be worrying about us thereupon mark broke
into a run for now that the exertion of hauling up jack was over he
began to feel cool and the chilling atmosphere of the moon struck
through to his bones
in a short time the two lads were back at the annihilator where
they found professors roumann and henderson getting a bit anxious about
them their adventure was quickly related and the boys were cautioned
to be more careful in the future
this moon is a curious desolate place said mr henderson and you
can not behave on it as you would on the earth we have discovered some
curious facts regarding it and when we get back i am going to write a
book on them but i think we have seen enough for the present so we will
stay in the rest of the day and plan for farther trips
are not we going to look for those diamonds asked jack who had
almost fully recovered from his recent experience
oh yes we will look around for them assented mr roumann i
think after a day or so we will move our projectile to another part
of the moon we want to see as much of it as possible
they sat discussing various matters and while doing so washington
white peered into the living cabin
has you got one ob dem torchlight processions to spare he asked
torchlight processions queried mark what do you think this is an
election wash
i guess he means a lifetorch suggested jack are you going out
wash
yais sah i did think i would take a stroll around maybe i kin find a
diamond fo my tie
laughing jack provided the colored man with one of the torches
instructing him how to use it and presently washington was seen
outside walking gingerly around as though he expected to go through
the crust of the moon any moment pretty soon however he got more
courage and tramped boldly along peering about on the ground for all
the world as mark said as if he was looking for chestnuts
they paid no attention to the cook for some little time until when the
boys and the two professors were in the midst of a discussion as to
where would be the best place to move the projectile next they heard
him running along the corridor toward the cabin
wash is in a hurry observed jack
the next instant they sprang to their feet at the sight of the
frightened face of the colored man peering in on them he was as near
white as a negro can ever be which is a sort of chalk color and his
eyes were wide open with fear
what is the matter asked jack
a ghost i done seen de ghost ob a dead man gasped the colored man
a ghost repeated mark
yais sah right out yeah he is lying down in a holea dead man
golly but i ise a scared coon i is and washington looked over his
shoulder as though he feared the ghost had followed him
chapter xxii
a breakdown
at first they were inclined to regard the announcement of washington
lightly but the too evident fright of the colored man showed that
there was some basis for his fear
tell us just what you saw and where it was said mr henderson was
the man alive washington
no sah how could a ghost be alive dey is all dead ones ghosts am
there are no such things as ghosts said mr henderson sternly
den how could i see one demanded the cook triumphantly as if there
was no further argument
well tell us about it suggested jack
it were jest dis way began washington earnestly and with occasional
glances over his shoulder i were walking along sort ob looking fer
dem sparkling diamonds and i did not see none when all on a suddint i
looked down in a hole and dere i seen him and he brought out the
word with a jerk
saw whatwho asked mr roumann
de ghostde dead man he were lying all curled up laik he were
asleep and when i seed him i did not stop to call him to dinner you
can make up you minds to dat all
can you show us the place inquired jack
yais sah massa jack dat is what i kin i will point it out from dish
yeah winder but i is not gwine dar agin no sah iscuse me
well show us then suggested mark i wonder what it can be he
went on
maybe one of the people who came from mars after the diamonds who was
forgotten and left here and who died said jack
it is possible murmured mr henderson however we will go take a
look get on your fur coats boys and take the lifetorches will you
come andy
sure it is got to be more than a ghost to scare me said the hunter
they emerged from the projectile and walked in the direction washington
had pointed holding their gas torches near their heads and talking of
what they might see
this will be evidence in favor of my diamond theory declared jack
it shows that the martians were here
wait and see what it is suggested his chum
they walked along a short distance farther and then mark spoke
that ought to be the place over there he said pointing to a
depression between two tall pinnacles of black rock
jack sprang forward and a moment later uttered a cry of astonishment
here it is he called a dead man
a dead man echoed professor henderson
a petrified man added jack in awestruck tones he is turned to
stone
a few seconds later they were all grouped around the strange objectit
was a man no longer but had once been one it was a petrified human
being a fullgrown man to judge by the size and it was a solid image
in stone even the garments with which he had been clothed being turned
to rock
for a moment no one spoke and they gazed in silence at what was an
evidence of former life on the moon the man was huddled up with the
knees drawn toward the stomach and the arms bent around the body as if
the man had died in agony the features were scarcely distinguishable
that man was never an inhabitant of mars spoke professor henderson
in a low voice he is much too large and he has none of the
characteristics of the martians
i agree with you came from mr roumann
then who is he asked jack
i think said the aged scientist that we are now gazing on all that
was once mortal of one of the inhabitants of the moon
an inhabitant of the moon gasped mark
yes why not went on mr henderson i believe the moon was once a
planet like our earthperhaps even a part of it and i think that it
was inhabited in time it cooled so that life could no longer be
supported or at least this side of the moon presents that
indication the people were killedfrozen to death and by reason of
the chemical action of the gases or perhaps from the moon being
covered with water in which was a large percentage of lime they were
turned to stone that is what happened to this poor man
such a thing is possible admitted professor roumann gravely
and indeed it is as the writer can testify for in the metropolitan
museum in new york there are the remains of an ancient south american
miner whose body has been turned into solid copper the corpse of
which the features are partly distinguishable was found four hundred
feet down in an old copper mine where the dripping from hidden
springs the waters of which were rich in copper sulphate had
converted the man is body into a block of metal retaining its natural
shape the body is drawn up in agony and there is every indication
that the man was killed by a cavein of the mine some of his tools
were found near him
they remained gazing at the weird sight of the petrified man for some
time
then the moon was once inhabited asked jack at length
i believe soyes answered professor henderson
then where are the other people asked mark there must be more than
one left why was this man off here alone
we do not know responded the german scientist perhaps he was off
alone in the mountains when death overtook him or perhaps all his
companions were buried under an upheaval of rock we can only
theorize
it will be something else to put in the book i am to write said mr
henderson but now that we have evidence of former life on the moon
we must investigate further we will make an attempt to go to the other
side of the country and to that end i suggest that we set our
projectile in motion and travel a bit there is little more to see
here
this plan met with general approval and after some photographs had
been taken of the petrified man and the professors had made notes and
set down data regarding him and had tried to guess how long he had
been dead they went back to the annihilator
well did you all see him asked washington
we sure did answered jack you were not mistaken that time
they got ready to move the projectile but decided to remain over night
where they were over night being the way they spoke of it though
as i have said there was perpetual daylight for fourteen days at a
time on the moon
professors roumann and henderson made a few more observations for
scientific purposes they found traces of some vegetation but it was
of little value for food even to the lower forms of animal life they
decided there was also a little moisture noticed at certain hours of
the day but in the main the place where they had landed was most
desolate
i hope we get to a better place soon said jack just before they
sealed themselves up in the projectile to travel to a new spot
as distance was comparatively small on the moon for her diameter is
only a little over two thousand miles and the circumference only about
six thousand six hundred miles the annihilator could not be speeded
up if it went too fast it would soon be off the moon and into space
again
accordingly the cardite motor was geared to send the big craft along at
about forty miles an hour and at times they went even slower than
that when they were passing over some part of the surface which the
professors wished to photograph or observe closely
they did not rise high into the air but flew along at an elevation of
about two hundred feet steering in and out to avoid the towering peaks
scattered here and there occasionally they found themselves over
immense craters that seemed to have no bottom
for two days they moved here and there finding no further signs of
life neither petrified nor natural though they saw many strange
sights and some valuable pictures and scientific data was obtained
it was on the third day when they were approaching the side of the
moon which from time immemorial has been hidden from view of the
inhabitants of the earth that jack who was with mark in the engine
room while the two professors were in the pilothouse remarked to his
chum mark does not it strike you that the water pump and the air
apparatus are not working just right
they do not seem to be operating very smoothly admitted mark after
an examination
that is what i thought let is call mr henderson the machinery may
need adjusting
jack started from the engine room to do this and as he paused on the
threshold there was a sudden crash part of the air pump seemed to fly
off at a tangent and a second later had smashed down on the cardite
motor this stopped in an instant and the projectile began falling
fortunately it was but a short distance above the moon is surface and
came down with a jar which did not injure the travellers
but there was sufficient damage done to the machinery for with the
breaking of the air pump the water apparatus also went out of
commission and together with the breakdown of the cardite motor had
fairly stalled the annihilator
what is the matter cried professor henderson running in from the
pilothouse for an automatic signal there had apprised him that
something was wrong
there is a bad break said jack ruefully
a bad break i should say there was remarked the scientist i think
we will have to lay up for repairs and he called mr roumann
chapter xxiii
lost on the moon
notwithstanding that they were somewhat accustomed to having accidents
happen it was not with the most pleasant feelings in the world that
the moon travellers contemplated this one it meant a delay and a
delay was the one thing they did not want just now
they desired to get to the other side of the moon while the long period
of sunshine gave them an opportunity for observation true there was
some time yet ere the long night of fourteen days would settle down
but they felt that they would need every hour of sunshine
well it is tough luck but it can not be helped said mark
no let is get right to work suggested jack
they got out their tools and started to repair the two pumps it was
found that the cardite motor was not badly damaged one of the negative
electrical plates merely having been smashed by a piece of the broken
connecting rod of the air pump it was only a short time before the
motor was ready to run again
but it could not be successfully operated without the air and water
pumps and it was necessary to fix them next new gaskets were needed
while an extra valve and some sliding gears had to be replaced
it is an all day is job remarked professor henderson
but many hands made light work and even washington and andy were
called upon to do their share by dinner time the work was more than
half done and professor roumann announced that he and mr henderson
would finish it if jack and mark would take a look at the exterior of
the projectile to see if any repairs were needed to that
the boys found that some of the exterior piping had become loosed at
the joints because of the jar of the sudden descent and taking the
necessary tools outside while they stuck their lifetorches upright
near them they labored away
at four oclock the two lads had their task completed and at the same
time professor henderson announced that the air and water pumps were
now in good shape again
then let is get under way at once suggested mr roumann we have
lost enough time as it is hurry inside boys and we will start
the two chums were glad enough to do so and in a few minutes they were
again moving through the air toward the unknown portion of the moon
below the travellers as they could see by looking down through a
plateglass window in the floor of the projectile were the same rugged
peaks the same large and small craters that had marked the surface of
the moon from the time they had first had a glimpse of it there was an
uninteresting monotony about it unrelieved by any save the very
sparest vegetation
i am beginning to think more and more that we will find people on the
other side of this globe remarked mr roumann as he made an
observation through a telescope
what strengthens your belief inquired mr henderson
the fact that the vegetation is growing thicker there are many more
plants below us now than there were before this part of the moon is
better able to support life than the portion we have just come from
this seemed to be so but they were still some distance from the
opposite side of the moon
i do not see anything of those diamonds you talked so much about
jack said mark with a smile a little later i guess all the
reonaris you get you can put in a hollow tooth
you wait was all jack replied
the projectile was slowed up to permit the two professors to make some
notes regarding a particularly large and deep crater and a few minutes
later when mark who was in the engine room attempted to speed up the
cordite motor it would not respond
humph i wonder what is wrong he asked of jack
better call mr roumann and not try to fix it yourself suggested
his chum when in response to various movements of the lever the
machine seemed to go slower and slower
the german came in answer to the summons
ha he exclaimed that motor is broken again we shall have to stop
once more for repairs i shall need to take it all apart i fear get
me the negative plate remover will you mark
the lad went to the tool chest for it he opened the lid and fumbled
about inside
it does not seem to be here he announced
what the negative plate remover not there cried the professor
why it must be it is one of the new tools we got and it has not
been used for anything has it
oh by jinks cried jack suddenly
what is the matter asked his chum
that plate remover do not you remember you and i had it when we were
fixing the pipes outside the projectile when we had the other
breakdown we must have left it back there on the ground
jack and his chum gazed blankly at each other
i guess we did admitted mark dubiously
and it is the only one we have said mr roumann we need it very
much too for the projectile can not very well be moved without it
how can we get it asked jack i am sorry it was my fault
it was as much mine as yours asserted mark i guess it is up to us
to go back after it it is not far we can easily walk it
there seemed to be nothing else to do and after some discussion it
was decided to have the two boys walk back after the missing tool
which was a very valuable one
take fresh lifetorches with you advised mr henderson and you had
better carry some food with you it may be farther back than you think
and you may get hungry
i guess it will be a good thing to take some lunch along admitted
jack and some water too we can not get a drink here unless we come to
a spring and we have not seen any since we arrived
i will go with you if you do not mind said andy i may see something
to shoot
the three of them each one carrying a freshly charged vaportorch a
basket of food and a bottle of water started off well wrapped in
their fur coats andy had a compass to enable them to make their way
back to where the tool was left for amid the towering peaks and the
valleylike depressions very little of the level surface of the moon
could be seen at a time
they walked on for several hours every now and then hoping that they
had reached the place where the projectile had been halted and where
they expected to find the tool but so many places looked alike that
they were deceived a number of times
at length however they reached the spot and found the instrument
where jack had carelessly dropped it they picked it up and turned to
go back when andy sudds saw a large crater off to one side
boys i am going to have a look down that he said it may contain a
bear or wildcat and i can get a shot
guess there is not much danger of a bear being on the moon said mark
but the old hunter leaned as far over the edge of the crater as he
dared
no there is nothing here he announced with almost a sigh and he
straightened up as he did so there came a tinkling sound as if some
one had dropped a piece of money
what is that asked jack
by heck it is the compass cried andy it slipped from my pocket
when i stooped over now it is gone
there was no question of that they could hear the instrument tinkling
far down in the unfathomable depths striking from side to side of the
crater as it went down and down
we will never see that again spoke mark dubiously can we get back to
the projectile without it asked jack
oh i fancy i can pick my trail back answered the hunter it is not
going to be easy for there are no landmarks to guide me but i will do
my best i ought to have known better than to put a compass in that
pocket
it was not with very light hearts that they started back and for a
time they went cautiously then as they seemed to get on familiar
ground they increased their pace and covered several miles
say remarked jack as he sat down on a big stone i do not know how
the rest of you feel but i am tired we have come quite a distance since
we picked up that tool
yes farther than it took us to find it after we left the projectile
added mark i wonder if we are going right
the two boys looked at andy he scratched his head in perplexity
i can not be sure but it seems to me that we came past here he said
i seem to remember that big rock
there are lots like it observed jack
suppose we try over to the left spoke mark after they had rested
for ten minutes
they swerved in that direction and after keeping on that trail for
some time and becoming more and more convinced that it was the wrong
one they turned to the right that did not bring them to familiar
ground and there was no sight of the projectile
let is go straight ahead suggested andy after a puzzled pause i
think that will be best
well which way is straight ahead asked mark
that is so it is hard to tell admitted the hunter i wish i had not
lost that compass
they wandered about for an hour longer they could seem to make no
progress though they covered much ground suddenly jack called out
say we have been going around in a circle
in a circle asked mark
yes went on his chum here is the very rock i sat down on a while
ago i remember it for i scratched my initials on it
jack pointed out the letters there was no disputing it they had made
a complete circle for a moment they maintained silence in the face of
this alarming fact then mark exclaimed
i guess we are lost
lost on the moon added jack in an awestruck voice and he gazed on
the chill and desolate scene all about them the great pinnacles of
rocks in fantastic form the immense black caverns of craters on
either hand the sickly green vegetation
lost on the moon whispered mark and there was not even an echo of
his voice to keep them company only a chill desolate silence
chapter xxiv
desolate wanderings
for a moment the three stood helplessly there and stared at each other
they could scarcely comprehend their situation at first then with a
glance at the cold and quiet scene all about them a look up at the
sun which was the only cheerful object in the whole landscape jack
observed oh i say come on now do not let is give up this way we
have only taken a wrong turn and i will wager that the projectile will
be just around the corner come on and he started off
yes said mark that is the trouble there are so many corners and
we have taken so many wrong turns that we are all confused i think the
best thing to do will be to stay here a while and pull ourselves
together
that is right spoke old andy many a time in the woods i have got all
confusedlike and then i would sit down and think and i would get on the
right path in a few minutes after
the trouble here is said jack that there are no woods if there
were we might know how to get out of them but think of it lost on
the moon in the midst of a whole lot of queer mountain peaks and big
holes that would hold half a dozen cities of the united states at the
same time and never know it this is a fearful place to be lost in
i am not going to admit that we are lost declared mark stoutly
hu you are like the indian spoke jack the indian who got lost in
the woods he insisted that it was not he who was lost that it was his
wigwam that could not be found he knew where he himself was all the
while that is our case i suppose we are here but the projectile is
lost
ha ha laughed andy sudds that is a pretty good joke
but not being able to find the projectile is no joke went on mark
who always took matters more seriously than did his chum what are we
going to do he added we can not stay here like this
maybe we will have to declared jack we certainly can not get off the
moonat least not until we reach the projectile and i would like to
discover those diamonds before we go back
hu those diamonds exploded mark i think this whole thing is a
wildgoose chase anyhow if it had not been for those diamonds we
would not have come to the moon i do not believe there are any diamonds
here anyhow
well i can not prove it to you now but i will before we get back
asserted jack we will be wearing diamonds as the song says
diamonds are not going to keep us warm when we are freezing went on
mark who seemed bound to look on the dark side and we can not eat them
when we are hungry a lot of good they will do us if we do find them
oh cheer up suggested jack cheerfully and speaking of eating
what is the matter with having some lunch what did we bring it along
for if we are not going to eat let is begin
his good spirits were contagious not that andy needed any special
cheering up but mark did in a few minutes they were seated on some
rugged rocks and with their lifetorches stuck in cracks so that the
perforated metal boxes of chemicals would be on a level with their
faces they opened the baskets they had been foresighted enough to
bring with them
why i feel better already asserted jack as he munched some
sandwiches which washington white had made as soon as we have finished
we will have another hunt for the projectile and i will wager that we will
find it
i would not finish if i were you suggested andy who was eating
sparingly
finish what asked jack
all your lunch you see the old hunter went on we may find the
projectile and again we may not i am inclined to think we are not so
very far from it but we may be some time locating it in among all
these peaks and craters so it will be the best plan to save some of
our lunch and drinking water untilwell until we are hungry again
and he carefully put back into his basket the remains of the food
you do not mean to say you think we will be all day finding the
annihilator do you
jack paused with a sandwich half way to his mouth as he asked this
question
well it is best to be on the safe side spoke andy guardedly we may
find it and again we may not save your powder against the time of
need i sayby powder meaning victuals and drink we can not drop in a
restaurant up here and i do not see much game to shoot and i should
hate to eat such fodder as this and he poked with his foot some
sickly green vines growing on the ground
the boys faces which had become more cheerful assumed a serious
look jack stopped eating at once and placed back in the basket his
remaining sandwiches he also corked up the bottle of water which was
kept from freezing by means of a fur pouch in which it was carried
if there is a possibility of being lost some time spoke mark we would
better figure out just how long our food will last and he examined
the contents of his basket
fortunately washington white with a knowledge of the appetites of the
chums had filled the baskets with lavish hands there was they found
food enough to last them three days if they ate sparingly and there
was enough water for half that time providing they only took small
sips when thirsty but they had noticed in one or two places little
pools of liquid which they had not tasted but which might prove to be
drinking water certainly they would need more if they were destined to
remain away from the projectile for very long
well then observed mark when the food calculation was over it
appears that we can remain lost for about three days at the most
oh but we will be back homei mean in the projectilelong before
that declared jack
i wish i was sure of that murmured andy with a dubious shake of his
head
well let is move on again suggested jack we feel better now and
maybe we will have better luck
they started off tramping over the rugged surface of the moon while
the sun shone with tepid heat down on them they had to go this way and
that to avoid the immense fissures in the ground or the yawning
craters which loomed deep and in awful silence in their path
sometimes they climbed small mountains or crawled in and out of small
craters slipping and stumbling
they were not cold for their fur garments kept them comfortably warm
and there was no wind to make the freezing temperature search through
the crevices of their clothing but it was the desolate silence the
utter absence of any form of life save the pale green vegetation that
got on their nerves it was like being in a dead worldon a planet
that seemed about to dissolve into space
they began their further search for the projectile with hope in their
hearts but this gradually gave way to despair as they wandered on over
the desolate surface and saw nothing but the same rugged peaks the
same yawning caverns and the innumerable craters large and small
on they wandered looking on all sides for the missing projectile but
they had no glimpse of it even climbing to one of the high peaks
whence they had a view of the surrounding country afforded them no
trace of the annihilator they were utterly lost
old andy who by reason of his experience as a trapper and hunter had
taken the lead came to a halt he looked around helplessly he did not
know what to do
well boys he remarked at length i do not like to say it but i
can not seem to get anywhere i give up
give up murmured jack in blank dismay
yes for the time being said the old man i am all played out i
guess we all are we must have a rest here is a sort of cave let is
crawl in and have a sleep then maybe we can do something tomorrow
no not tomorrow for they do not have that on the moon where the day
is fourteen days longbut after we sleep we may be able to find our
way back anyhow i have got to get some sleep and without another word
the old hunter went into the cave and fixing his lifetorch near his
head where the fumes from it would dissipate the poisonous gases of
the moon he closed his eyes and was soon in slumber
ii guess we would better do the same said jack and mark nodded they
were both sick at heart
chapter xxv
the petrified city
for a time after they had entered the cave which was in the side of a
rugged mountain the boys talked in low tones of their perilous
situation for that it was perilous they both knew had they been on
the earth lost in some desolate part of it away from civilization
their plight would have been bad enough with what little food they
possessed
but on the faroff moonthe dead moon which contained no living
creatures save themselves as far as they could tellwith no form of
animal life that might serve to keep them from starving with only the
scantiest of vegetation their situation was most deplorable
and then there is another thing said mark as if he was cataloguing a
list of their troubles
what is it asked jack i guess we have all the troubles that belong
to us and more too
well what are we going to do when the lifetorches give out and we
can not breathe any more asked mark dubiously
well i guess it will be all up with us then if we do not starve to
death in the meanwhile answered jack but i am afraid we will get out
of food before the torches are exhausted they were freshly filled
before we started out after that tool and they will last for two weeks
so we do not have to worry about that
by jinks this is all my fault anyhow it seems if i had not seen
that item in the martian paper about the diamonds we never would have
come here and if i had not left that tool on the ground outside of the
projectile we would not have had to come back after it and we would not
have become lost so i guess it is up to me as the boys say
oh nonsense exclaimed mark who as soon as he heard his chum
blaming his own actions was ready to shoulder part of the
responsibility himself we all wanted to come to the moon he went
on and as for leaving the tool and forgetting it i am as much at
fault as you are let is go to sleep and maybe we will feel better when
we wake up
it was a new role for markto be cheerful in the face of difficulties
and jack appreciated it they stretched out on the hard rocky floor
of the cavern taking care to fix their lifetorches so that the fumes
would dispel the poisonous gases then the two lads joined andy in
slumberland
meanwhile as may be imagined those aboard the projectile were very
anxious about the fate of the two boys and the hunter they could not
understand what delayed them and though they guessed the real cause
after several hours had passed there was nothing the two scientists
could do
they could not move the projectile until it had been repaired and this
could not be done without the toolat least they did not believe so
then nor did mr henderson and the german think it would be safe to
start out in search of the wanderers
for said mr henderson if we went we would easily get lost amid
these peaks ourselves and they are so much alike and in such numbers
that there is no distinguishing feature about them we had better stay
here in charge of the annihilator until the boys and andy come back
they can not be away much longer now
so worn out and exhausted were the boys and the hunter that they slept
for several hours in the cave and the rest did them good they awoke
in better spirits and after a frugal meal and a sip of the fast
dwindling water they started off once more to locate the projectile
i am a regular amateur hunter to go and lose my compass complained
old andy i ought to have it fastened to me like a baby does the
rattlebox i ought to kick myself and he accepted all the blame for
their misadventure but the boys would not suffer him to thus accuse
himself and they insisted that they would shortly be with the two
professors and washington in the annihilator once more
well it can not come any too soon said jack for i am beginning to
feel the need of a square meal and a big drink of water
so am i said mark but let is not think of it
all that day they wandered on crossing the rugged mountains climbing
towering peaks and descending into deep valleys at times they skirted
the lips of craters to look shudderingly into the depths of which made
them dizzy for the bottoms were lost to sight in the black gloom that
enshrouded the yawning holes
their food was getting less and less and what there was of it was most
unpalatable for the bread was stale and dry though the meat kept
perfectly in that freezing temperature how they longed for a hot cup
of coffee such as washington used to make and how they would have
even exchanged their chance of filling their pockets with the moon
diamonds for a good meal such as was so often served in the
projectile
on and on they went once as they were crossing the lip of a great
crater mark became dizzy and would have fallen had not jack caught
him mark had forgotten for the moment and had lowered his life
torch so that his mouth and nose were not enclosed in the film of
vapor that emanated from the perforated box
you must be careful andy warned them
what is the use asked mark despondently i do not believe we will ever
find the projectile
of course we will exclaimed jack i know we can not be far from it
only we can not see it because of the mountains if we only had some way
of letting them know where we are they could signal to us
by gum suddenly exclaimed andy
what is the matter asked jack for the old hunter was capering about
like a boy
matter why the matter is that i am a doublebarrelled dunce was the
answer look here do you see that and he held up his rifle
sure replied jack wondering if their sufferings and worry had made
the old hunter simpleminded
what is it asked andy shaking it in the air
your rifle answered mark looking at jack in surprise
of course answered the hunter and a rifle is made to be fired off
and here i have been carrying mine for nearly three days now and i
have not shot it once you wanted a signal to make the folks in the
projectile hear us well here it is i i guess they can hear this and
when they do they can come and get us for we do not seem able to reach
them i will just fire some signal shots
that is the stuff cried jack and andy proceeded to discharge his
rifle
the report the gun made in that quiet place was tremendous and the
effect was curious for there being no air in the ordinary acceptance
of the word there was no echo it was as if one had hit two shingles
together merely a loud sharp sound and then an utter silence the
vibrations being swallowed up instantly
do you think they can hear that asked andy
it sounds loud enough answered jack shoot some more which the
old hunter did they wandered on still farther firing at intervals all
that day but there came no answering report or calls to direct them to
the projectile they climbed once more to the tops of towering peaks
but there they found their range of vision limited by peaks still
higher while there were great valleys in one of which whether near
or far they could not tell they knew the annihilator was hidden
they had almost lost track of time now and they did not know how far
they had wandered they had sought out lonely caves to sleep in when
they were so weary they could go no farther and they had sat about on
bleak rocks shivering and had eaten their scanty mealsshivering
because in spite of their fur garments they were cold as they did not
eat enough to keep their blood properly circulating they could not
when they did not have the food to eat
andy used up all but a few of his cartridges in firing signals but to
no purpose their water was all but gone and of their food only enough
remained for a day longer though their lifetorches still gave forth
plenty of vapor
well what is to be done asked jack as they sat about looking
helplessly at one another
might as well give up suggested mark bitterly
give up not a bit of it cried andy as cheerfully as he could
let is keep on we will find the projectile sooner or later
so they kept on it was while making their way between two great
mountain peaks that towered above their heads on either side thousands
of feet up making a sort of natural gateway that jack who was in the
lead cried out in astonishment at the sight that met his gaze when he
had passed the pinnacles
look he shouted pointing forward
what he indicated was a great craterlarger and deeper than any they
had yet met with it seemed a mile across and if gloom and darkness
were any indications it was a hundred miles deep
but it was not the size of the great hole in the ground not its
fearful gloom that attracted their attention what did was a great
natural or artificial bridge of stone that was thrown across the middle
of it from edge to edge a bridge of stone that spanned the abyss a
roadway fifty feet wide which reached into some unknown land
connecting it with the desolate country in which our friends had been
wandering
a bridge of stone across the cavern said jack but see here is a
house of stone this was the guardhouse i will wagerthe guardhouse at
the entrance to some city and that bridge is the means by which the
inhabitants entered and left maybe we are at the edge of the inhabited
part of the moon
his words thrilled them they pressed forward to the beginning of the
bridge across the crater they looked into the stone hut clearly it
had been made by hands for it was composed of blocks of stone neatly
fitted together jack is theory seemed confirmed
mark peered into the house and uttered a cry of alarm
there is a petrified man in there he gasped
jack and andy looked in at the open window they saw sitting at a
table which was also of rock a man evidently a soldier or rather he
had been for he was nothing but stone now like the hut in which he
dwelt
the wanderers looked at each other with fear on their faces what
dreadful mystery were they about to penetrate let is cross the
bridge suggested jack in a low voice maybe this marks the end of
desolation perhaps we may find life and food across the crater
butbut the petrified man gasped mark
what of it he will not hurt us maybe there are live men who will take
care of us beyond there and jack pointed across the bridge of stone
there was nothing to keep them where they werein the land of
desolation they could not live much longer there with no food and
water to pass on over the crater seemed the only thing to do
come ahead called jack boldly they followed him they kept in the
middle of the road for to approach the edge where there was a sheer
descent of so many feet that it made them dizzy to think of it filled
them with terror on they hurried until in a short time they had
crossed the great chasm
the road over the crater came to an end between two peaks similar to
those at the beginning jack was the first to pass them and as he
emerged he once more uttered a crya cry of fear and wonder
and well he might for in a valley below the wanderers there was a
city a great city with wonderful buildings with wide streets well
laid outa city in which figures of many men and women could be seen
little children too a fair city teeming with life it seemed
but then as they looked again struck by the curious quiet that
prevailed they knew that they were gazing down on a city of the dead
a city where the inhabitants had been turned to stone even as had the
soldier on guard in his lonely hut
they had come upon a petrified city of the moon
chapter xxvi
seeking food
well if this is not the limit burst out jack when he had stood and
contemplated the silent city for several moments which also his
companions did after all our wanderings and troubles when we do find
a place it is not any good to us i do not suppose there is a square
meal in the whole town is not it wonderful thoughevery person turned
to stone
wonderful gasped old andy i never saw anything like it in all my
life what do you reckon did it boys
the same thing that turned the man in the hut and the one washington
thought was a ghost into stone answered mark there was a rain of
some limewater or a liquid charged with similar chemicals and the
people were turned to rocks
it was uncanny and for a moment they hesitated on the edge of the
city which lay in a sort of cuplike valley surrounded on all sides
by towering peaks of the moon mountains the bridge over which they had
come afforded the only entrance to the city and in times of war
provided the inhabitants of the moon ever fought the passage must
have been well guarded
it was evidently a time of peace when the calamity that turned the
inhabitants to stone came upon them for only one soldier was in the
guard hutdoubtless being there merely to give an alarm or possibly
to keep out undesirable strangers
well are we going to stand here all day asked jack of his
companions when they had contemplated the silent city for five minutes
longer
i say let is go down there and see what we can find i am getting
hungry
there will be nothing there to eat declared mark if there ever was
anything it is now stone think of a loaf of bread like a brick and a
chunk of meat like some great rock
let is go down anyhow added andy and they advanced
as they got down into the streets the weird effect came over them more
strongly it was as if they had suddenly entered some large town and
at their advent every living person had been turned into an image
wonderful wonderful murmured jack
i have read of the uncovering of the ancient buried cities and how they
found women in the kitchen baking bread and men at their work but
this goes ahead of that for here the people are not dustthey are
statues
it certainly is wonderful agreed mark i only wish the two
professors could see this they could write several books about it
this proves that the moon was once inhabited though it is dead now
the projectile should have come to this part of the moon
maybe they will bring it here when we get back and tell them what we have
seen suggested jack
yes if we ever do get back went on his chum with a return of his
gloomy thoughts
the strangeness of the scenes all about them can scarcely be imagined
think of looking at a city street teeming with life men and women
hurrying here and there dogs running about children at their play
and then suddenly seeing that same street become as dead as some
mountain with the people represented as stones on that same mountain
and you can get some idea of what our friends looked upon
here was a woman looking in a store window probably at some bargains
though even the very window and store itself was now stone and the
woman was like a block of marble near her was a little child also
turned to stone and there were a number of men standing together on a
street corner as if they had been talking politics when the calamity
overtook them
there were shops where the workers had been turned to stone at their
benches there were houses at the windows of which stone faces peered
out and there were parks on the benches of which sat men women and
children stiff and solidcreatures of stone truly it was a city of
the dead
the wanderers walked about seeing new wonders on every side they
spoke in whispers at times as though at the sound of a loud voice the
silent ones would awaken and resume the occupations or pleasures they
had left off centuries ago
another strange part of it was that the people were not so very
different from those of the earth they were exactly the same in size
and feature but their clothing as nearly as could be told from the
stone garments seemed of a bygone fashion such as was in vogue
hundreds of years ago there were no horses observed though there were
stone dogs and cats and the shops given over to the sale of food
contained in the windows what seemed to be chunks of meat loaves of
bread and pies and cakes though now they were only pieces of rock
it is just as if one of our cities and the people in it should be
suddenly petrified said mark it is almost like the earth up here
only they do not seem to have gotten to trolley cars yet
maybe they would if the moon had not cooled off when it did and killed
them all suggested jack but i say let is get down to something
more practical than theorizing
what for instance asked mark
looking for something to eat went on jack i am nearly starved and
i have only half a sandwich left i want to eat it yet if i do i
do not know where i am going to get more and as for water i would give a
handful of diamonds if i had them for half a glass of even warm
water
yes we do need food and water badly said andy
then let is look for it suggested jack if we can find food in any
of these houses or shops i do not believe the people will care if we
take it
find food here cried mark why you must be crazy all the food is
turned to stone and what is not would be spoiled why no one has been
alive here for thousands and thousands of years
that is nothing asserted jack do not you remember reading how in
the arctic regions they have found the bodies of prehistoric elephants
and mastodons encased in blocks of ice where they have been for
centuries the meat is perfectly preserved because of the cold and
what of the grains of wheat they find in the coffins of egyptian
mummies some of that is three thousand years old yet it grows when
they plant it and they can make bread of it
now maybe we can find some wheat or something to eat in some of these
houses if there is meat it will be perfectly preserved for the
temperature is below freezing
that may be admitted mark convinced in spite of himself but it is
turned to stone i tell you
the outside part may be said jack but if we can crack off the
outside layer of stone we may find some good meat inside i am going to
look anyhow
that is not a bad idea cried andy with enthusiasm think of having a
loaf of bread and some beefsteak thousands of years old i suppose they
had beefsteak here he added cautiously
some kind of meat anyhow agreed jack well let is look for a place
that was once a restaurant or hotel and we will see what luck we have
come on
they walked along the silent streets with their silent occupants and
finally jack found what he was seeking it was an eating place to
judge by the appearance and at tables inside were seated stone men and
women
back to the kitchen cried jack with enthusiasm there is where we will
find food if there is any
it will be all stone declared mark but he and andy followed jack
they came to the place where was what appeared to be a stove it was
more like a brick oven however than a modern range though in dishes
that were now stone something was being cooked when the catastrophe
occurred
there is meat i will wager cried jack pointing to several objects on
a table they looked like chunks of beef but when mark struck them
with the end of his lifetorch they gave forth a sound as if a rock had
been tapped
what did i tell you mark asked nothing but rocks and the bread is
also a stone he added bitterly
you are right admitted jack with a sigh and i am getting hungrier
than ever they all were for days they had been without sufficient
food and now when it was almost within their reach they were denied
it by this curious trick of nature with pale and wan faces they gazed
at each other wetting their parched lips for they had some time since
taken the last of their scant supply of water and they were very
thirsty
i guess it is all up with us murmured mark we will soon be like these
poor people hereblocks of stone
if we only could change this meat back into it is original shape
spoke jack musingly smiting his fist against a block of beef
suddenly andy uttered a cry
i have it he fairly shouted
what asked jack
i have a plan to get meat out of this hunk of stone
the two boys gazed at the old hunter as though they thought he had lost
his reason but chuckling gleefully andy took from his pouch several
cartridges and proceeded to remove the wads and pour the powder from
the paper shells out on the stone table
i will have some meat for us he muttered we sha not starve now
chapter xxvii
the black pool
what are you going to do andy asked jack as he watched the old
hunter
what am i going to do why i am going to blast out some of this meat
that is what i am going to do i heard you boys talking about elephants
and other things being preserved for centuries in a cake of ice and
if that is true why will not the meat in this petrified city be preserved
just as well it is always below freezing here and that is cold enough
but the meat has turned to stone objected mark
only the outside part of it to my thinking answered andy i
believe that inside these lumps of rock we will find good fresh meat
but how are you going to get it asked jack
just as i told youblast it out with some of the powder from my
cartridges i used to be a miner before i turned hunter and when we
wanted gold we used to fire a charge in some rocks now we want meat
and i am going to do the same thing i will put some powder underneath
this block of stone that looks as if it was a chunk of roast beef and
we will see what happens it is lucky i saved some of my cartridges
while he was talking the old hunter had taken some of the powder and
put it back in one of the paper shells then making a fuse by twisting
some powder grains in a piece of paper he happened to have in his
pocket he inserted it in the improvised bomb using some dirt and
small stones with which to tamp down the charge he discovered a crack
in the big stone which they hoped would prove to be a chunk of roast
beef and andy put the cartridge in that
look out now boys he called i am going to light the fuse i did not
make a heavy charge but it might do some damage so we will go outside
they hurried from the place with its silent guests and waiters and
reached the street a moment later there sounded a dull explosion
now let is see what we have got called jack
back to the kitchen they ran the two boys in the lead
whywhythe stone has disappeared cried jack in disappointment
as he glanced all around
yes but look here added mark here are bits of meat and he
picked up from the stone table some scraps of meat
is it really roast beef cried jack good to eat
mark smelled of it then he put the morsel cautiously to his lips the
next instant it had disappeared it was proof enough
good i should say it was good exclaimed mark i wish there was
more of it what happened to the rock of meat andy
i used too heavy a charge and it blew all to pieces i will know better
next time there are lots more chunks of meat and we will soon have a
feast i will make another bombshell
he worked rapidly while jack sampled some of the shreds of meat that
had been scattered about by the explosion the beef was perfectly
cooked and in spite of its great age it was as fresh and palatable as
frozen meat ever is besides the heat generated by the explosion had
partly thawed it so that there was no trouble in chewing it
once more came the explosion a slight one this time and when the
adventurers reentered the kitchen they found that what had been a lump
of stone had been broken open and the middle part like the kernel of
a nut was sweet and good it was cooked so they did not have to eat
it raw
say maybe this is not good exclaimed jack chewing away it is the
best ever
and there is enough in this city to keep us alive for months if we
can not find the projectile in that time declared andy
do not you think we will asked mark
of course but i was only just mentioning it now eat all you want
boys i have quite a few cartridges left i did not fire away as many as
i thought i did and we can blast out a dinner any time we want it so
eat hearty
they needed no second invitation and for the first time in several
days they had enough to eat it was comfortable in the petrified
restaurant too for they could move about without carrying their life
torches constantly in their hand the gases from the perforated boxes
filled the rooms and were not quickly dispelled by the poisonous
vapors as they were outside so they could walk around in comparative
freedom
now if we could only blast out a loaf of bread we would be all right
said jack they found some petrified loaves but on breaking one open
it was found to be stone all the way through
spurred on by an overwhelming thirst they wandered about the dead
city but found no moisture they tried to chew some of the pale green
vegetation that grew more plentiful on this side of the moon but it
was exceedingly bitter and they could not stand it though there was
some juice in it
they crossed the city and wandered out into the country beyond it
appeared to have been a fertile land before the stone death settled
down on it they saw farmers in the fields turned into images beside
the oxen with which they had been plowing but nowhere was there a sign
of water had it not been for a frozen rice pudding they would have
perished that first day in the stone city
as it was they dragged out a miserable existence eating from time to
time of the blasted meat but even this palled on them after a while
for their lips were parched and cracked and their tongues were swollen
in their mouths
i can not stand this any longer cried jack
what are you going to do asked mark
go out and look for water there must be some in the country outside
if there is not any in this city i am going to have a look besides if
i am going to die i might as well die while i am busy i am not going to
sit here in this dreadful place and give up
his words urged them to follow him and with lagging steps for they
were weak and faint they went from the restaurant which they had made
their home since coming to the petrified city
out into the open fields they went but their search seemed likely to
be in vain between times of looking for the water they scanned the sky
for a sight of the projectile which hoping against hope they thought
they might see hovering over them but there was no sight of it
they came to a vast level plain girt with mountains a lonesome
place where there was no sign of life listlessly they walked over it
suddenly andy who was in the lead uttered a cry and sprang forward
the boys ran to him and found the old hunter gazing into the depths of
a great black pool which filled a depression in the surface of the
moon it was a small crater and was filled nearly to the top with
some black liquid which gloomily reflected back the light of the sun
i am going to have a drink cried andy and before the boys could stop
him he threw himself face downward at the edge of the black pool
chapter xxviii
the signal fails
stop do not drink that it may be poison yelled jack
pull him back shouted mark and together they advanced on the old
hunter they tried to drag him away from the black pool but andy shook
them off
letmealone he gasped as he bent over the uninviting liquid and
drank deeply it is water i tell yougood waterand i am almost
deadfromthirst
water is that water cried jack
well it is the nearest thing to it that i have tasted since i have been
lost on the moon spoke andy as he slowly arose my but that was
good he added fervently
butwater gasped mark how can there be water here
taste and see invited the old hunter
they hesitated a moment and then followed his example the liquid
water it evidently had once beenhad a peculiar taste but it was not
bad by some curious chemical action which they never understood the
liquid had been prevented from evaporating nor was it frozen or
petrified as was everything else on the moon
what gave the liquid its peculiar black color they could not learn
sufficient for them that it was capable of quenching their thirst and
they all drank deeply and refilled their bottles
now i feel like eating again spoke andy we can take some of this
back with us and have a good meal on blasted meat whenever we get
thirsty we will have to make a trip back here for water
the boys agreed with him they examined the black pool it appeared to
be filled by hidden springs though there was no bubbling and the
surface was as unruffled as a mirror the liquid was not very inviting
being as black as ink but the color appeared to be a sort of
reflection for when the water if such it was had been put into
bottles it at once became clear nor did it stain their faces or hands
well it is another queer thing in this queer moon said jack i wish
the two professors could see this place they would have lots to write
about
i wonder if we will ever see them again asked mark
sure replied jack hopefully we will fill our lunch baskets take a
lot of water along and have another hunt for the projectile soon
they did but with no success for several days more they lived in the
petrified city the meat encased in its block of stone which andy
blasted from time to time and the black water keeping them alive from
time to time they went out in the surrounding country looking for the
projectile but they could not find the place where they had left it
nor could they find even the place where they had picked up the lost
tool that had cost them so much suffering they were more completely
lost than ever they crossed back and forth on the bridge over the
crater chasm and penetrated for many miles in a radius from that
marking their way by chipping off pieces of the rocky pinnacles as
they did not want to leave the petrified city behind
from some peaks they caught glimpses of other towns that had fallen
under the strange spell of the petrification some were larger and some
smaller than the one they called home
jack proposed visiting some of them thinking they might find better
food but mark and andy decided it was best to stay where they were as
they were nearer the supposed location of the projectile
i think they will manage to fix it up somehow so it will move said
andy and then they will come to look for us i hope it will be soon
though
why asked jack struck by something in the tone of the old hunter
because replied andy i am afraid our lifetorches will not last much
longer mine seems to be weakening i have to hold it very close to my
face now to breathe in comfort while at first the oxygen from it was
so strong that i could hold it two feet off and never notice the
poisonous moon vapors
this was a new danger and thinking of it the faces of the boys
became graver than ever death seemed bound to get them somehow
two more days went by they had now been lost on the moon over a week
each one now noticed that his lifetorch was weakening how much longer
would they last they dared not answer that question they could only
hope
the sun too was moving away from them soon the long night would set
in by mark is computation there was only three more days of daylight
left what would happen in the desolate darkness
as they were returning from the black pool with their water bottles
filled and put inside the fur bags to prevent the frost from reaching
them mark happened to gaze over across a line of towering peaks what
he saw caused him to gasp in astonishment
jack andy see he whispered hoarsely pointing a trembling finger
at the sky
there outlined against the cloudless heavens was a long black shape
floating through the air about two miles distant
the projectile the annihilator yelled jack shout call to them
wave your hands andy fire your gun they have started off and they
can not see us we must make them hear
together they raised their voices in a mighty shout the old hunter
fired his gun several times they waved their hands frantically
but the projectile never swerved from its course on it moved slowly
those in it paying no heed to the wanderers for they did not hear
them andy fired his gun again but the signal failed and a few
minutes later the annihilator was lost to sight behind a great peak
chapter xxix
the field of diamonds
dumbly the wanderers gazed at each other they could not comprehend it
at first that the projectile on which their very lives depended in
this dead world of the moon should float away and leave them seemed
incredible yet they had witnessed it
dodo you really think we saw itsaw the annihilator mark asked
jack in a low voice after several minutes had passed
saw it of course we saw it we have seen the last of it i am afraid
but what do you mean
ii thought maybe i was out of my head and i only saw a vision
answered jack you knowa sort of mirage it was real then
altogether too real spoke andy sudds grimly they did not see us nor
hear us we are left behind
but can not we do something demanded mark let is start off and try to
catch them they were going slow
the wonder to me is how they moved at all said jack i thought the
machinery would not work until we got back with the lost tool
probably the two professors found some way of patching up the motor
was mark is opinion and later they found that this was so
for some time they remained staring in the direction in which the
projectile had vanished as if they might see it reappear but the
great steel shell did not poke its sharp nose in among the towering
peaks which hid it from view probably it was many miles away now
well remarked old andy at length we have got to make the best of it
we will not have many more days of light and we must gather what food we
can put it where we can find it in the dark and also bring in some
water from the black pool we can store that in some of the stone
tables by turning them upside down they will make good troughs and it
will not freeze we must work while we have light for soon the long night
will come
the sight of the projectile going away seemed to take the heart out of
all of them and they did not know what to do for some time they
remained there idly until andy roused the boys to a sense of their
responsibility by urging upon them the necessity of getting together a
store of meat and water
as they had about exhausted the limited food supply in the ancient
restaurant they sought and found another and larger one there they
had the good fortune to come upon some whole sides of beef and lamb
which were petrified on the outside but which when they had blasted
off the outer shell of stone gave them good food
they made several trips to the black pool and brought in all the
liquid they could for they did not want to have to go outside the
petrified city into the wild and desolate country beyond after the
dismal night had settled down they feared they would become lost
again
their lonely situation seemed to grow upon them the appalling silence
all about terrified them the weird sight of the petrified men and
women in the petrified city got on their nerves
they had done all they could a store of meat had been blasted out and
put away it would keep outside of the stone shell now for the weather
was getting colder with the advent of the long night
this fact worried them with the temperature at twentyeight when the
sun was shining what might it not fall to in the darkness the
terrible cold of the arctic regions might be nothing compared to the
frostiness of the dead moon in the shadow their fur garments thick as
they were might be no more protection than so much paper and they had
no means of making a fire nor anything to burn on one had they been
capable of kindling it for andy had used the last of his cartridges to
blast with and where everything was petrified there was no wood
then too their lifetorches were giving out the emanations of oxygen
were weaker and they had to hold them almost under their noses to
breathe the vital vapor
one day or rather what corresponded to a day for they had lost all
track of time andy sudds arose from the stone bench on which their
meager meal had been served he started from the restaurant where they
had taken up their abode
where are you going asked jack
i am going to make one last attempt to find the projectile before it
gets too dark answered the hunter we can go out look around for
several hours and get back before darkness sets in we might as well
do it as sit here doing nothing then too we can bring in some more
water we will need all we can store away
i will go with you volunteered jack and mark not wanting to be left
alone in the dead city followed carrying their lifetorches and
wrapping their fur garments closely about them for it had grown much
colder they sallied forth
they found a thin film of ice on the black pool showing that it would
probably freeze when it got cold enough though the ordinary
temperature of thirtytwo degrees had not affected it they filled
their water bottles and then andy proposed that they take a new path
one they had not tried before
they hardly knew where they were going but ever as they tramped on
they cast anxious looks upward to see if they might descry the
projectile hovering over them but they did not see it
jack had taken the lead and was walking along glancing idly about he
came to a place where two peaks were so close together that it was all
he could do to squeeze through but the moment he had passed the defile
and looked out on a broad level field he came to a sudden stop his
companions who pressed after him saw him rub his eyes and shake his
head as if disbelieving the evidence of what lay before him then jack
murmured it can not be true it can not be true
what called mark
there those answered his chum see the field is covered with
diamonds we have found the diamonds of the moonthe field of reonaris
that the men of mars discovered there are the diamondsmillions of
them
diamonds exclaimed mark he squeezed through the defile and stood
beside jack before him in the fading light of the sun was a broad
field girt around with towering cliffs and the surface of the field
was covered with white stones
jack sprang forward and gathered up a double handful he let them run
through his fingers in a sparkling stream old andy came up to the
boys
they are only glass or crystals he said
they are not glass or crystals declared mark who had made a study
of gems i should say they were diamonds probably meteoric diamonds
very rare and valuable why there is the ransom of a thousand kings
spread out before us
he fell upon his knees and began to scoop up the gems his chum was
making a little heap of the stones
the ransom of a thousand kings murmured jack more diamonds than in
all the worldand i would give my share for a good ham sandwich
chapter xxx
back to earthconclusion
at any other time the discovery of such a vast store of wealth would
have set the wanderers half wild with joy now they only accepted the
fact dully for the perils of their situation overburdened them as
jack had said they needed food more than the gems for at best the
supply they had blasted out could not last long and when that was gone
where were they to get more for there were no more cartridges and the
rending force of powder was needed to open the rocky meat
i knew we would find the diamonds murmured jack as he began to fill the
pockets of his fur coat i am right after all mark you see
yes but what good will it do us what is the good of even carrying any
away we can never use them
that is so agreed jack in a low voice i might as well leave them
here
but somehow the desire to pick up gems which when they were cut and
polished would rival many of the famous diamonds of history was too
strong to be resisted though he was afraid he would never get back to
earth to enjoy them jack could not help putting in his pockets a
goodly supply of the largest of the precious stones andy did the same
and mark in spite of his gloomy feelings stuffed his pockets they
worked with their torches held close to their faces and in the search
for the better stones they literally walked over millions of dollars
worth of the gems
for there stretched out before them was an actual field of diamonds
as mark had said they were of meteoric origin that is a meteor had
burst over that particular portion of the moon and the chemical action
had created the diamonds which had fallen in a shower in the field
if you boys have all you want then let is get back to the city
suggested andy no telling when it will be night now
they followed his advice and soon were going back by way of the black
pool it seemed more lonesome than ever after the excitement of
discovering the field of diamonds and even jack glad as he was to
have his theory vindicated got tired of referring to it his triumph
meant little to him now
they were at the entrance to the petrified city as they were about to
go in ready to hide themselves in the deepest part of the restaurant
away from the terrible cold and appalling darkness they felt would soon
be upon them mark came to a sudden halt he glanced quickly up into
the air and cried out hark
what is the matter asked jack as they stood in a listening attitude
i heard a noise whispered mark it soundedi am sure it sounded
like the crackling of the wireless motor waves of the projectile
listen
faintly through the silence came a sound as if there was a discharge of
an electric current it increased in volume and there was a faint
roaring in the atmosphere
it is herit is the annihilator shouted jack leaping about
wait counselled andy who dreaded the terrible disappointment should
the boys be mistaken the sound came nearer the crackling could
plainly be made out now the sun was out of sight but there was still
the glow which follows sunset
the boys were eagerly scanning the heavens their hearts beat high with
hope suddenly in the olivetinted sky just above a range of rugged
peaks a black shape loomed a black shape as of a great cigar
pointed at both ends it shot into full view
the projectile yelled jack
the annihilator gasped mark
thank heaven they have found us in time exclaimed andy fervently
and the three stretched out their arms toward the craft from which they
had been parted so long it was as if they tried to pull it down to
them
do they see us
will they pass us by
make a noise so they will hear us
wave to them
oh if they leave us now
questions ejaculations and entreaties came rapidly from the lips of
the wanderers they raised their voices in a shout they leaped up and
down they wildly waved their hands and lifetorches
then to their inexpressible joy they saw the course of the projectile
change it was headed toward them and a few minutes later it settled
slowly to the ground about half a mile away
come on cried jack we must hurry to them or soon it will be too
dark to see them or for them to find us it is our last chance do not
let is lose it
he sprang forward the others after him and together they ran toward
the projectile they could see the two professors and washington white
emerging from the steel car waving their hands
on rushed the lost wanderers over the rough stones skirting the great
cliffs falling into small craters crawling out again just missing
several times being precipitated into yawning caverns and stumbling
over petrified bodies that strewed the ground
ever did they hasten onward though increasing their speed they came
to a great crater that lay between them and the projectile but
fortunately there was across the middle of it a natural bridge of
stone but it was narrowscarcely wide enough for one at a time
we can never cross on that cried mark halting
we have got to shouted jack and he sprang fearlessly forward fairly
running over the narrow path which had a sheer descent of thousands of
feet on either side
mark though fearful that he would become dizzy and fall followed
andy they were soon across the narrow bridge and speeding on toward
the annihilator five minutes later they had reached it and were
being wildly welcomed by the two professors and washington white who
had advanced to meet them
i clar to goodnessgladness exclaimed the colored man i am
suttinly constrained to espress my approbation ob de deleterous manner
in which you all has come back to dis continuous territory
do you mean you are glad to see us wash asked jack
dat is what i done said was the answer with a cheerful grin and i
might also remark dat dinner am serbed in de dining car
hurrah cried jack that is the best news i have heard in a week no
more blasted beef for mine give me ham and eggs
but what happened to you where have you been we have searched all
over for you and were just giving you up for dead and going back to
the earth said professor henderson we caught sight of you at the
last minute
oh you must not go back until you go to the field of diamonds cried
jack and then by turns he and mark and andy told of their terrible
adventures while they were lost on the moon
on their part professors roumann and henderson stated how they had
waited in vain for the return of the wanderers and had then by
strenuous work managed to make the necessary repairs without the
missing tool then they set out to discover the lost ones but
succeeded only just in time for it was now quite dusk
and did you all really discober dem sparklers asked washington as
he served what the boys thought was the finest dinner they had ever
tasted
we sure did replied jack here are a couple for that red necktie of
yours and he passed over two big diamonds
it did not take long to move the projectile to the field of the
sparkling gems and by means of a powerful searchlight enough were
soon gathered up to satisfy even washington white who declared that he
would be the best decorated colored man in bayside when they got back
the two professors made what observations they could in the petrified
city in the fastgathering darkness and then having taken a petrified
man into the projectile with them to deposit in a scientific museum in
which professor roumann was interested the annihilator was sealed
shut
and it was only just in time for with the suddenness of an eclipse
intense darkness settled down and the temperature as indicated by a
thermometer thrust outside showed a drop of a hundred degrees
we never could have lived out there said jack
well we will soon be back on earth observed mark and a little later
the cardite motor was out in operation and the journey back to this
world begun
little of moment happened on the return trip the boys went more into
detail about their wanderings and told how they had managed to live
during the time they were lost the two professors and washington spoke
of their worry and anxiety and their vain search for the wanderers
as they were anxious to get back home the motor was speeded to the
limit and in much less time than they had made the trip to the moon
they had arrived in sight of the earth again as they did not want to
create too much excitement they hovered about in the air over bayside
until dark when they gently descended almost in the very spot from
which they had started
well remarked jack as he stepped out on the earth once more it
was quite an experience to go to the moon and i suppose being lost
there was not the worst thing that could happen to us but all the same
i am glad to be back
so am i declared mark it was worth while going and he felt of
his pocketful of diamonds
we certainly made some very valuable scientific observations
asserted mr henderson and we will be able to prove that the moon was
once inhabited
washington white was carefully lifting out his shanghai rooster which
was uttering loud crows as soon as he had set the fowl on the ground
the colored man started off
where are you going asked mark
i am going to a jewelery shop to hab my diamonds made inter a stickpin
fo my red necktie was the answer
oh you would better wait until morning suggested professor henderson
they gathered about the table in the cozy dining room of their home
while washington got a meal ready every one was talking about what a
wonderful trip they had had
the only trouble is said jack that we have been to about all the
interesting places in this universe now i wonder where we can go
next
i am going to bed right after supper announced mark maybe i will
discover a new land in my dreams
the moon voyagers had a great store of gems and as they did not wish
to bring down values by disposing of them they only sold a few which
because of their great size and brilliancy brought a large price
several jewelers wanted to know where the diamonds came from but the
secret was well kept most of the gems were used for scientific
purposes but mark and jack gave some to certain of their friends
the petrified man proved a great curiosity and a history of it in two
large volumes can be seen in the museum where the body is exhibited
professor henderson wrote the account and also published quite an
extensive history of the trip to the moon which was considered by
scientists and laymen to be a most remarkable journey
but though our friends had been to many strange places it was
reserved for them to have yet still more wonderful adventures though
for a time after returning from the moon they remained at home the two
professors busy over their scientific work and the boys engaged with
their studies while andy occasionally went hunting and washington got
the meals and between times fed his rooster and admired the diamonds
in his red necktie and now we will bid our friends goodby
the end
